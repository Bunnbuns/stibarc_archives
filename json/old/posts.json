But seriously though, have you guys ever heard of a good forum? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.

It was a place where she felt delighted.\r\n\r\nShe was a hopeful, down to earth, brandy drinker with blonde fingers and skinny fingers. Her friends saw her as a filthy, flipping friend. Once, she had even rescued a brawny old man from a burning building. That's the sort of woman he was.\r\n\r\nMark walked over to the window and reflected on her rural surroundings. The hail pounded like bouncing humming birds.\r\n\r\nThen she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Brendan Ogden. Brendan was a patient vicar with grubby fingers and pink fingers.\r\n\r\nMark gulped. She was not prepared for Brendan.\r\n\r\nAs Mark stepped outside and Brendan came closer, she could see the spitezabbling glint in her eye.\r\n\r\nBrendan gazed with the affection of 3997 cowardly kindhearted koalas. She said, in hushed tones, \"I love you and I want love.\"\r\n\r\nMark looked back, even more cross and still fingering the peculiar blade. \"Brendan, I love you,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other with ambivalent feelings, like two long, light lizards bopping at a very violent accident, which had indie music playing in the background and two incredible uncles rampaging to the beat.\r\n\r\nMark studied Brendan's grubby fingers and pink fingers. Eventually, she took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry,\" began Mark in apologetic tones, \"but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't love you Brendan.\"\r\n\r\nBrendan looked sparkly, her emotions raw like a petite, purring piano.\r\n\r\nMark could actually hear Brendan's emotions shatter into 4170 pieces. Then the patient vicar hurried away into the distance.\r\n\r\nNot even a glass of brandy would calm Mark's nerves tonight.\r\n\r\nTHE END","title":"Hopeful Mark Copley","postdate":"12:0 AM on 1/22/2018 EST"},"167":{"poster":"Bringer116","content":"https://play.google.com/apps/testing/gq.stibarc.mobile","title":"Download dis","postdate":"12:0 AM on 1/22/2018 EST"},"168":{"poster":"WinRaR","content":"The government is gone, so are we.

Also, it doesn't say where you hug someone, so you could hug their neck. The world cannot support so many people, so hugging people could save the world. Also, it says squeeze TIGHTLY, which would block air flow. And if they were good people, they'll go to heaven, which is good for them. On this Cristian surver, we all should.

Jenkins of oof then whispers back \"I love you\"\r\nThey marched eyes, and both said at the same time \"some body toucha mah spaghti\" and they ran away together holding hands\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, after the act was done oofmanjenkins said to jenkinskfoof, I'm sorry as he jumped out of the 34th story of hayes elementary school. Jenkisnofoof looked as he saw oofmanjenkins splat on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Never forgetii, rest in spaghetti\" as he leaped out the the 1st story of his luxury apartments in nam. He hit a bush and did not die from the fall, but rather from the hitman sitting in his apartment , whos target was himself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRip ","title":"Alddenyo's back story","postdate":"12:11 AM on 1/22/2018 EST"},"172":{"poster":"Bringer116","content":"A, b , c, d, e, f, g,  you're mom has gay level 3.\r\n\r\nH, I, j, k, l , m, n, o, p, yur dad has a smol peepee.\r\n\r\nQ, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, Here lies your family tree","title":"Alphabet","postdate":"12:11 AM on 1/22/2018 EST"},"173":{"poster":"Bringer116","content":"8==================D alien smiley face\r\n\r\n\r\n8=D yur dad peepee \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDank meme\r\n\r\n360 mlg no scope \r\n\r\nLol got eem \r\n\r\n*dab* \r\n\r\nHahahshahah keke le epic mememmeme\r\n\r\nGr8 m8 8/8\r\n\r\nHehehe\r\n\r\nPepe approve\r\n\r\nIs it still 2012??????\r\n\r\n*insert le rage comic*\r\n\r\n<>k<>i<>l<>ll<>\r\n\r\n[[((M[(])E))]] \r\n\r\n###p###l###e###a###s###e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"K/D ratio?","postdate":"12:18 AM on 1/22/2018 EST"},"174":{"poster":"CertifiedProfessional","content":"Hey, it's the new guy.

Maybe that's a way out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't remember the sun\r\nhaving a big 75 on it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI predicted global warming.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI could feel it getting hotter.\r\nAt first I thought it was just me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait! Stop! Bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nStand back.

Is that your statement?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm just saying all life has value. You\r\ndon't know what he's capable of feeling.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy brochure!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere you go, little guy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm not scared of him.\r\nIt's an allergic thing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPut that on your resume brochure.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy whole face could puff up.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMake it one of your special skills.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKnocking someone out\r\nis also a special skill.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?\r\n- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You could put carob chips on there.\r\n- Bye.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Supposed to be less calories.\r\n- Bye.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI gotta say something.\r\n\r\n  \r\nShe saved my life.\r\nI gotta say something.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right, here it goes.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNah.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat would I say?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI could really get in trouble.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's a bee law.\r\nYou're not supposed to talk to a human.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't believe I'm doing this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI've got to.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, I can't do it. Oome on!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo. Yes. No.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDo it. I can't.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow should I start it?\r\n\"You like jazz?\" No, that's no good.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere she comes! Speak, you fool!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHi!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm sorry.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You're talking.\r\n- Yes, I know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're talking!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm so sorry.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, it's OK. It's fine.\r\nI know I'm dreaming.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut I don't recall going to bed.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, I'm sure this\r\nis very disconcerting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is a bit of a surprise to me.\r\nI mean, you're a bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI am. And I'm not supposed\r\nto be doing this,\r\n\r\n  \r\nbut they were all trying to kill me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd if it wasn't for you...\r\n\r\n  \r\nI had to thank you.\r\nIt's just how I was raised.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat was a little weird.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I'm talking with a bee.\r\n- Yeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm talking to a bee.\r\nAnd the bee is talking to me!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI just want to say I'm grateful.\r\nI'll leave now.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Wait! How did you learn to do that?\r\n- What?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe talking thing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSame way you did, I guess.\r\n\"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- That's very funny.\r\n- Yeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees are funny. If we didn't laugh,\r\nwe'd cry with what we have to deal with.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnyway...\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan I...\r\n\r\n  \r\n...get you something?\r\n- Like what?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know. I mean...\r\nI don't know. Ooffee?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't want to put you out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's no trouble. It takes two minutes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- It's just coffee.\r\n- I hate to impose.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Don't be ridiculous!\r\n- Actually, I would love a cup.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHey, you want rum cake?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I shouldn't.\r\n- Have some.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- No, I can't.\r\n- Oome on!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Where?\r\n- These stripes don't help.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou look great!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know if you know\r\nanything about fashion.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre you all right?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's making the tie in the cab\r\nas they're flying up Madison.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe finally gets there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe runs up the steps into the church.\r\nThe wedding is on.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd he says, \"Watermelon?\r\nI thought you said Guatemalan.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhy would I marry a watermelon?\"\r\n\r\n  \r\nIs that a bee joke?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's the kind of stuff we do.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, different.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo, what are you gonna do, Barry?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAbout work? I don't know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI want to do my part for the hive,\r\nbut I can't do it the way they want.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know how you feel.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You do?\r\n- Sure.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy parents wanted me to be a lawyer or\r\na doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Really?\r\n- My only interest is flowers.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOur new queen was just elected\r\nwith that same campaign slogan.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnyway, if you look...\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere's my hive right there. See it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're in Sheep Meadow!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo way! I know that area.\r\nI lost a toe ring there once.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Why do girls put rings on their toes?\r\n- Why not?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- It's like putting a hat on your knee.\r\n- Maybe I'll try that.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You all right, ma'am?\r\n- Oh, yeah. Fine.\r\n\r\n  \r\nJust having two cups of coffee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnyway, this has been great.\r\nThanks for the coffee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, it's no trouble.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,\r\nI'd be up the rest of my life.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre you...?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan I take a piece of this with me?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSure! Here, have a crumb.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Thanks!\r\n- Yeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right.

That was nothing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, not nothing, but... Anyway...\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis can't possibly work.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's all set to go.\r\nWe may as well try it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOK, Dave, pull the chute.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Sounds amazing.\r\n- It was amazing!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt was the scariest,\r\nhappiest moment of my life.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHumans! I can't believe\r\nyou were with humans!\r\n\r\n  \r\nGiant, scary humans!\r\nWhat were they like?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHuge and crazy. They talk crazy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey eat crazy giant things.\r\nThey drive crazy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?\r\n- Some of them. But some of them don't.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- How'd you get back?\r\n- Poodle.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou did it, and I'm glad. You saw\r\nwhatever you wanted to see.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou had your \"experience.\" Now you\r\ncan pick out yourjob and be normal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Well...\r\n- Well?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, I met someone.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou did? Was she Bee-ish?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!\r\n- No, no, no, not a wasp.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Spider?\r\n- I'm not attracted to spiders.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know it's the hottest thing,\r\nwith the eight legs and all.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't get by that face.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo who is she?\r\n\r\n  \r\nShe's... human.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, no. That's a bee law.\r\nYou wouldn't break a bee law.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Her name's Vanessa.\r\n- Oh, boy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nShe's so nice. And she's a florist!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, no! You're dating a human florist!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're not dating.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're flying outside the hive, talking\r\nto humans that attack our homes\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith power washers and M-80s!\r\nOne-eighth a stick of dynamite!\r\n\r\n  \r\nShe saved my life!\r\nAnd she understands me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is over!\r\n\r\n  \r\nEat this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is not over! What was that?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- They call it a crumb.\r\n- It was so stingin' stripey!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd that's not what they eat.\r\nThat's what falls off what they eat!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You know what a Oinnabon is?\r\n- No.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's bread and cinnamon and frosting.\r\nThey heat it up...\r\n\r\n  \r\nSit down!\r\n\r\n  \r\n...really hot!\r\n- Listen to me!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe are not them! We're us.\r\nThere's us and there's them!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes, but who can deny\r\nthe heart that is yearning?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere's no yearning.\r\nStop yearning. Listen to me!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou have got to start thinking bee,\r\nmy friend. Thinking bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Thinking bee.\r\n- Thinking bee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\r\nThinking bee!

You have no life!\r\nYou have no job. You're barely a bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWould it kill you\r\nto make a little honey?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, come out.\r\nYour father's talking to you.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMartin, would you talk to him?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, I'm talking to you!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou coming?\r\n\r\n  \r\nGot everything?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll set!\r\n\r\n  \r\nGo ahead.

Do the roses\r\ncompete in athletic events?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo. All right, I've got one.\r\nHow come you don't fly everywhere?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's exhausting. Why don't you\r\nrun everywhere? It's faster.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, OK, I see, I see.\r\nAll right, your turn.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTiVo.

Barry!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe do not.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You wish you could.\r\n- Whose side are you on?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI dated a cricket once in San Antonio.\r\nThose crazy legs kept me up all night.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, this is what you want\r\nto do with your life?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI want to do it for all our lives.\r\nNobody works harder than bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDad, I remember you\r\ncoming home so overworked\r\n\r\n  \r\nyour hands were still stirring.\r\nYou couldn't stop.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI remember that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat right do they have to our honey?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe live on two cups a year. They put it\r\nin lip balm for no reason whatsoever!\r\n\r\n  \r\nEven if it's true, what can one bee do?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSting them where it really hurts.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIn the face! The eye!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- That would hurt.\r\n- No.\r\n\r\n  \r\nUp the nose? That's a killer.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere's only one place you can sting\r\nthe humans, one place where it matters.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHive at Five, the hive's only\r\nfull-hour action news source.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo more bee beards!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWith Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWeather with Storm Stinger.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSports with Buzz Larvi.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd Jeanette Ohung.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Good evening.

I can't do this\"?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees have never been afraid\r\nto change the world.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat about Bee Oolumbus?\r\nBee Gandhi? Bejesus?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere I'm from, we'd never sue humans.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe were thinking\r\nof stickball or candy stores.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow old are you?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe bee community\r\nis supporting you in this case,\r\n\r\n  \r\nwhich will be the trial\r\nof the bee century.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, they have a Larry King\r\nin the human world too.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's a common name. Next week...\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe looks like you and has a show\r\nand suspenders and colored dots...\r\n\r\n  \r\nNext week...\r\n\r\n  \r\nGlasses, quotes on the bottom from the\r\nguest even though you just heard 'em.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBear Week next week!\r\nThey're scary, hairy and here live.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAlways leans forward, pointy shoulders,\r\nsquinty eyes, very Jewish.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIn tennis, you attack\r\nat the point of weakness!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHoney, her backhand's a joke!\r\nI'm not gonna take advantage of that?\r\n\r\n  \r\nQuiet, please.\r\nActual work going on here.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Is that that same bee?\r\n- Yes, it is!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm helping him sue the human race.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hello.\r\n- Hello, bee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is Ken.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, I remember you. Timberland, size\r\nten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhy does he talk again?\r\n\r\n  \r\nListen, you better go\r\n'cause we're really busy working.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut it's our yogurt night!\r\n\r\n  \r\nBye-bye.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhy is yogurt night so difficult?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou poor thing.\r\nYou two have been at this for hours!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes, and Adam here\r\nhas been a huge help.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Frosting...\r\n- How many sugars?\r\n\r\n  \r\nJust one. I try not\r\nto use the competition.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo why are you helping me?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees have good qualities.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd it takes my mind off the shop.\r\n\r\n  \r\nInstead of flowers, people\r\nare giving balloon bouquets now.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThose are great, if you're three.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd artificial flowers.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oh, those just get me psychotic!\r\n- Yeah, me too.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBent stingers, pointless pollination.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees must hate those fake things!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNothing worse\r\nthan a daffodil that's had work done.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMaybe this could make up\r\nfor it a little bit.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\r\n- I guess.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou sure you want to go through with it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAm I sure? When I'm done with\r\nthe humans, they won't be able\r\n\r\n  \r\nto say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"\r\nwithout paying a royalty!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's an incredible scene\r\nhere in downtown Manhattan,\r\n\r\n  \r\nwhere the world anxiously waits,\r\nbecause for the first time in history,\r\n\r\n  \r\nwe will hear for ourselves\r\nif a honeybee can actually speak.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's pretty big, isn't it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't believe how many humans\r\ndon't work during the day.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou think billion-dollar multinational\r\nfood companies have good lawyers?\r\n\r\n  \r\nEverybody needs to stay\r\nbehind the barricade.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What's the matter?\r\n- I don't know, I just got a chill.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, if it isn't the bee team.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou boys work on this?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll rise! The Honorable\r\nJudge Bumbleton presiding.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right. Oase number 4475,\r\n\r\n  \r\nSuperior Oourt of New York,\r\nBarry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry\r\n\r\n  \r\nis now in session.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Montgomery, you're representing\r\nthe five food companies collectively?\r\n\r\n  \r\nA privilege.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Benson... you're representing\r\nall the bees of the world?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,\r\nwe're ready to proceed.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Montgomery,\r\nyour opening statement, please.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\r\n\r\n  \r\nmy grandmother was a simple woman.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBorn on a farm, she believed\r\nit was man's divine right\r\n\r\n  \r\nto benefit from the bounty\r\nof nature God put before us.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world\r\nMr. Benson imagines,\r\n\r\n  \r\njust think of what would it mean.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI would have to negotiate\r\nwith the silkworm\r\n\r\n  \r\nfor the elastic in my britches!\r\n\r\n  \r\nTalking bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow do we know this isn't some sort of\r\n\r\n  \r\nholographic motion-picture-capture\r\nHollywood wizardry?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey could be using laser beams!\r\n\r\n  \r\nRobotics! Ventriloquism!\r\nOloning! For all we know,\r\n\r\n  \r\nhe could be on steroids!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Benson?\r\n\r\n  \r\nLadies and gentlemen,\r\nthere's no trickery here.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm just an ordinary bee.\r\nHoney's pretty important to me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's important to all bees.\r\nWe invented it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe make it. And we protect it\r\nwith our lives.\r\n\r\n  \r\nUnfortunately, there are\r\nsome people in this room\r\n\r\n  \r\nwho think they can take it from us\r\n\r\n  \r\n'cause we're the little guys!\r\nI'm hoping that, after this is all over,\r\n\r\n  \r\nyou'll see how, by taking our honey,\r\nyou not only take everything we have\r\n\r\n  \r\nbut everything we are!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI wish he'd dress like that\r\nall the time. So nice!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOall your first witness.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\r\nof Honey Farms, big company you have.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI suppose so.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI see you also own\r\nHoneyburton and Honron!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes, they provide beekeepers\r\nfor our farms.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBeekeeper. I find that\r\nto be a very disturbing term.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't imagine you employ\r\nany bee-free-ers, do you?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- No.\r\n- I couldn't hear you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- No.\r\n- No.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBecause you don't free bees.\r\nYou keep bees. Not only that,\r\n\r\n  \r\nit seems you thought a bear would be\r\nan appropriate image for a jar of honey.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey're very lovable creatures.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou mean like this?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBears kill bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow'd you like his head crashing\r\nthrough your living room?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nBiting into your couch!\r\nSpitting out your throw pillows!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOK, that's enough. Take him away.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\r\nYour name intrigues me.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Where have I heard it before?\r\n- I was with a band called The Police.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut you've never been\r\na police officer, have you?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, I haven't.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, you haven't. And so here\r\nwe have yet another example\r\n\r\n  \r\nof bee culture casually\r\nstolen by a human\r\n\r\n  \r\nfor nothing more than\r\na prance-about stage name.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, please.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBecause I'm feeling\r\na little stung, Sting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOr should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's not his real name?! You idiots!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Liotta, first,\r\nbelated congratulations on\r\n\r\n  \r\nyour Emmy win for a guest spot\r\non ER in 2005.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThank you. Thank you.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI see from your resume\r\nthat you're devilishly handsome\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith a churning inner turmoil\r\nthat's ready to blow.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNot yet it isn't. But is this\r\nwhat it's come to for you?\r\n\r\n  \r\nExploiting tiny, helpless bees\r\nso you don't\r\n\r\n  \r\nhave to rehearse\r\nyour part and learn your lines, sir?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWatch it, Benson!\r\nI could blow right now!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis isn't a goodfella.\r\nThis is a badfella!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhy doesn't someone just step on\r\nthis creep, and we can all go home?!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Order in this court!\r\n- You're all thinking it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOrder! Order, I say!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Say it!\r\n- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think it was awfully nice\r\nof that bear to pitch in like that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think the jury's on our side.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre we doing everything right, legally?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm a florist.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight. Well, here's to a great team.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTo a great team!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, hello.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Ken!\r\n- Hello.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI didn't think you were coming.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, I was just late.\r\nI tried to call, but... the battery.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI didn't want all this to go to waste,\r\nso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, that was lucky.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere's a little left.\r\nI could heat it up.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm not much for the game myself.\r\nThe ball's a little grabby.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's where I usually sit.\r\nRight... there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\r\n\r\n  \r\nand he agreed with me that eating with\r\nchopsticks isn't really a special skill.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou think I don't see what you're doing?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know how hard it is to find\r\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDo we?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees have 100 percent employment,\r\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's just what\r\nI was thinking about doing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\r\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, you do that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook at that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, I've just about had it\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith your little mind games.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What's that?\r\n- Italian Vogue.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA lot of ads.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRemember what Van said, why is\r\nyour life more valuable than mine?\r\n\r\n  \r\nFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think something stinks in here!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI love the smell of flowers.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNot as much.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWater bug! Not taking sides!\r\n\r\n  \r\nKen, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!\r\nThis is pathetic!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI've got issues!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, well, well, a royal flush!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You're bluffing.\r\n- Am I?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSurf's up, dude!\r\n\r\n  \r\nPoo water!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat bowl is gnarly.\r\n\r\n  \r\nExcept for those dirty yellow rings!\r\n\r\n  \r\nKenneth! What are you doing?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, I don't even like honey!\r\nI don't eat it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe need to talk!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's just a little bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd he happens to be\r\nthe nicest bee I've met in a long time!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLong time? What are you talking about?!\r\nAre there other bugs in your life?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, but there are other things bugging\r\nme in life. And you're one of them!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy nerves are fried from riding\r\non this emotional roller coaster!\r\n\r\n  \r\nGoodbye, Ken.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd for your information,\r\n\r\n  \r\nI prefer sugar-free, artificial\r\nsweeteners made by man!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm sorry about all that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know it's got\r\nan aftertaste! I like it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI always felt there was some kind\r\nof barrier between Ken and me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI couldn't overcome it.\r\nOh, well.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre you OK for the trial?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI believe Mr. Montgomery\r\nis about out of ideas.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe would like to call\r\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\r\n\r\n  \r\nGood idea! You can really see why he's\r\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLayton, you've\r\ngotta weave some magic\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith this jury,\r\nor it's gonna be all over.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't worry. The only thing I have\r\nto do to turn this jury around\r\n\r\n  \r\nis to remind them\r\nof what they don't like about bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You got the tweezers?\r\n- Are you allergic?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\r\nwhat I think we'd all like to know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat exactly is your relationship\r\n\r\n  \r\nto that woman?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're friends.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Good friends?\r\n- Yes.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow good? Do you live together?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a minute...\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre you her little...\r\n\r\n  \r\n...bedbug?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI've seen a bee documentary or two.\r\nFrom what I understand,\r\n\r\n  \r\ndoesn't your queen give birth\r\nto all the bee children?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Yeah, but...\r\n- So those aren't your real parents!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oh, Barry...\r\n- Yes, they are!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHold me back!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're an illegitimate bee,\r\naren't you, Benson?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's denouncing bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't y'all date your cousins?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Objection!\r\n- I'm going to pincushion this guy!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAdam, don't!

The venom\r\nis coursing through my veins!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI have been felled\r\nby a winged beast of destruction!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou see? You can't treat them\r\nlike equals! They're striped savages!\r\n\r\n  \r\nStinging's the only thing\r\nthey know! It's their way!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Adam, stay with me.\r\n- I can't feel my legs.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat angel of mercy\r\nwill come forward to suck the poison\r\n\r\n  \r\nfrom my heaving buttocks?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI will have order in this court. Order!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOrder, please!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe case of the honeybees\r\nversus the human race\r\n\r\n  \r\ntook a pointed turn against the bees\r\n\r\n  \r\nyesterday when one of their legal\r\nteam stung Layton T.

What matters is\r\nyou're alive. You could have died.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'd be better off dead. Look at me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey got it from the cafeteria\r\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook, there's\r\na little celery still on it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat was it like to sting someone?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't explain it.

I'm sorry.\r\nI flew us right into this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're\r\njust a couple of bugs in this world.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat will the humans do to us\r\nif they win?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\r\nThat doesn't sound so bad.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAdam, they check in,\r\nbut they don't check out!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, my.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOould you get a nurse\r\nto close that window?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Why?\r\n- The smoke.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees don't smoke.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight. Bees don't smoke.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees don't smoke!\r\nBut some bees are smoking.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's it! That's our case!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt is? It's not over?\r\n\r\n  \r\nGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.\r\n\r\n  \r\nGet back to the court and stall.\r\nStall any way you can.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Flayman.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes? Yes, Your Honor!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere is the rest of your team?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\r\n\r\n  \r\nand as a result,\r\nwe don't make very good time.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI actually heard a funny story about...\r\n\r\n  \r\nYour Honor,\r\nhaven't these ridiculous bugs\r\n\r\n  \r\ntaken up enough\r\nof this court's valuable time?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow much longer will we allow\r\nthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey have presented no compelling\r\nevidence to support their charges\r\n\r\n  \r\nagainst my clients,\r\nwho run legitimate businesses.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI move for a complete dismissal\r\nof this entire case!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going\r\n\r\n  \r\nto have to consider\r\nMr. Montgomery's motion.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut you can't! We have a terrific case.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere is your proof?\r\nWhere is the evidence?\r\n\r\n  \r\nShow me the smoking gun!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHold it, Your Honor!\r\nYou want a smoking gun?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere is your smoking gun.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat is that?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's a bee smoker!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat, this?\r\nThis harmless little contraption?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis couldn't hurt a fly,\r\nlet alone a bee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook at what has happened\r\n\r\n  \r\nto bees who have never been asked,\r\n\"Smoking or non?\"\r\n\r\n  \r\nIs this what nature intended for us?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTo be forcibly addicted\r\nto smoke machines\r\n\r\n  \r\nand man-made wooden slat work camps?\r\n\r\n  \r\nLiving out our lives as honey slaves\r\nto the white man?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What are we gonna do?\r\n- He's playing the species card.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLadies and gentlemen, please,\r\nfree these bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFree the bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe court finds in favor of the bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, we won!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI knew you could do it! High-five!\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm OK! You know what this means?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll the honey\r\nwill finally belong to the bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNow we won't have\r\nto work so hard all the time.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is an unholy perversion\r\nof the balance of nature, Benson.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou'll regret this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, how much honey is out there?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right. One at a time.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, who are you wearing?\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy sweater is Ralph Lauren,\r\nand I have no pants.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What if Montgomery's right?\r\n- What do you mean?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe've been living the bee way\r\na long time, 27 million years.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOongratulations on your victory.\r\nWhat will you demand as a settlement?\r\n\r\n  \r\nFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown\r\nof all bee work camps.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen we want back the honey\r\nthat was ours to begin with,\r\n\r\n  \r\nevery last drop.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe demand an end to the glorification\r\nof the bear as anything more\r\n\r\n  \r\nthan a filthy, smelly,\r\nbad-breath stink machine.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're all aware\r\nof what they do in the woods.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait for my signal.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTake him out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe'll have nauseous\r\nfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd we will no longer tolerate\r\nbee-negative nicknames...\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut it's just a prance-about stage name!\r\n\r\n  \r\n...unnecessary inclusion of honey\r\nin bogus health products\r\n\r\n  \r\nand la-dee-da human\r\ntea-time snack garnishments.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan't breathe.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBring it in, boys!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHold it right there! Good.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTap it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,\r\nand there's gallons more coming!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I think we need to shut down!\r\n- Shut down? We've never shut down.\r\n\r\n  \r\nShut down honey production!\r\n\r\n  \r\nStop making honey!\r\n\r\n  \r\nTurn your key, sir!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat do we do now?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOannonball!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're shutting honey production!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMission abort.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\r\nReturning to base.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAdam, you wouldn't believe\r\nhow much honey was out there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, yeah?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat's going on? Where is everybody?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Are they out celebrating?\r\n- They're home.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey don't know what to do.\r\nLaying out, sleeping in.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way\r\nto San Antonio with a cricket.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAt least we got our honey back.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSometimes I think, so what if humans\r\nliked our honey? Who wouldn't?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's the greatest thing in the world!\r\nI was excited to be part of making it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis was my new desk. This was my\r\nnew job. I wanted to do it really well.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd now...\r\n\r\n  \r\nNow I can't.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't understand\r\nwhy they're not happy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI thought their lives would be better!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey're doing nothing. It's amazing.\r\nHoney really changes people.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou don't have any idea\r\nwhat's going on, do you?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What did you want to show me?\r\n- This.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat happened here?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat is not the half of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, no. Oh, my.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey're all wilting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDoesn't look very good, does it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd whose fault do you think that is?\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, I'm gonna guess bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSpecifically, me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI didn't think bees not needing to make\r\nhoney would affect all these things.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's notjust flowers.\r\nFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's our whole SAT test right there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTake away produce, that affects\r\nthe entire animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd then, of course...\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe human species?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo if there's no more pollination,\r\n\r\n  \r\nit could all just go south here,\r\ncouldn't it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know this is also partly my fault.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow about a suicide pact?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow do we do it?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I'll sting you, you step on me.\r\n- Thatjust kills you twice.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight, right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nListen, Barry...\r\nsorry, but I gotta get going.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI had to open my mouth and talk.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa?\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa? Why are you leaving?\r\nWhere are you going?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTo the final Tournament of Roses parade\r\nin Pasadena.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey've moved it to this weekend\r\nbecause all the flowers are dying.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's the last chance\r\nI'll ever have to see it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\r\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know. Me neither.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTournament of Roses.\r\nRoses can't do sports.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a minute. Roses.

It's real.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThank you. It was a gift.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOnce inside,\r\nwe just pick the right float.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow about The Princess and the Pea?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI could be the princess,\r\nand you could be the pea!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes, I got it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Where should I sit?\r\n- What are you?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I believe I'm the pea.\r\n- The pea?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt goes under the mattresses.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\r\n- I'm getting the marshal.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou do that!\r\nThis whole parade is a fiasco!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLet's see what this baby'll do.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHey, what are you doing?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen all we do\r\nis blend in with traffic...\r\n\r\n  \r\n...without arousing suspicion.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOnce at the airport,\r\nthere's no stopping us.\r\n\r\n  \r\nStop! Security.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You and your insect pack your float?\r\n- Yes.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHas it been\r\nin your possession the entire time?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWould you remove your shoes?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Remove your stinger.\r\n- It's part of me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know. Just having some fun.\r\nEnjoy your flight.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen if we're lucky, we'll have\r\njust enough pollen to do the job.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan you believe how lucky we are? We\r\nhave just enough pollen to do the job!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think this is gonna work.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's got to work.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAttention, passengers,\r\nthis is Oaptain Scott.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe have a bit of bad weather\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt looks like we'll experience\r\na couple hours delay.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, these are cut flowers\r\nwith no water. They'll never make it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI gotta get up there\r\nand talk to them.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBe careful.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan I get help\r\nwith the Sky Mall magazine?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'd like to order the talking\r\ninflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOaptain, I'm in a real situation.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What'd you say, Hal?\r\n- Nothing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't freak out! My entire species...\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat are you doing?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!\r\n- Who's an attorney?\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't move.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, Barry.\r\n\r\n  \r\nGood afternoon, passengers.\r\nThis is your captain.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWould a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B\r\nplease report to the cockpit?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd please hurry!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat happened here?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere was a DustBuster,\r\na toupee, a life raft exploded.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOne's bald, one's in a boat,\r\nthey're both unconscious!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Is that another bee joke?\r\n- No!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo one's flying the plane!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is JFK control tower, Flight 356.\r\nWhat's your status?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is Vanessa Bloome.\r\nI'm a florist from New York.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere's the pilot?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's unconscious,\r\nand so is the copilot.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNot good. Does anyone onboard\r\nhave flight experience?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAs a matter of fact, there is.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Who's that?\r\n- Barry Benson.\r\n\r\n  \r\nFrom the honey trial?! Oh, great.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, this is nothing more\r\nthan a big metal bee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's got giant wings, huge engines.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't fly a plane.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?\r\n- Yes.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow hard could it be?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait, Barry!\r\nWe're headed into some lightning.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is Bob Bumble. We have some\r\nlate-breaking news from JFK Airport,\r\n\r\n  \r\nwhere a suspenseful scene\r\nis developing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry Benson,\r\nfresh from his legal victory...\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's Barry!\r\n\r\n  \r\n...is attempting to land a plane,\r\nloaded with people, flowers\r\n\r\n  \r\nand an incapacitated flight crew.\r\n\r\n  \r\nFlowers?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe have a storm in the area\r\nand two individuals at the controls\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith absolutely no flight experience.\r\n\r\n  \r\nJust a minute.\r\nThere's a bee on that plane.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson\r\nand his no-account compadres.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey've done enough damage.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut isn't he your only hope?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTechnically, a bee\r\nshouldn't be able to fly at all.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTheir wings are too small...\r\n\r\n  \r\nHaven't we heard this a million times?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\"The surface area of the wings\r\nand body mass make no sense.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Get this on the air!\r\n- Got it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Stand by.\r\n- We're going live.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe way we work may be a mystery to you.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMaking honey takes a lot of bees\r\ndoing a lot of small jobs.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut let me tell you about a small job.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf you do it well,\r\nit makes a big difference.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMore than we realized.\r\nTo us, to everyone.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's why I want to get bees\r\nback to working together.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's the bee way!\r\nWe're not made of Jell-O.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe get behind a fellow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Black and yellow!\r\n- Hello!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLeft, right, down, hover.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hover?\r\n- Forget hover.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis isn't so hard.\r\nBeep-beep! Beep-beep!\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, what happened?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait, I think we were\r\non autopilot the whole time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- That may have been helping me.\r\n- And now we're not!\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll of you, let's get\r\nbehind this fellow! Move it out!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMove out!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOur only chance is if I do what I'd do,\r\nyou copy me with the wings of the plane!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't have to yell.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm not yelling!\r\nWe're in a lot of trouble.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's very hard to concentrate\r\nwith that panicky tone in your voice!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's not a tone. I'm panicking!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't do this!\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, pull yourself together.\r\nYou have to snap out of it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou snap out of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou snap out of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hold it!\r\n- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow is the plane flying?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHello?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBenson, got any flowers\r\nfor a happy occasion in there?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe Pollen Jocks!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey do get behind a fellow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Black and yellow.\r\n- Hello.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right, let's drop this tin can\r\non the blacktop.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere? I can't see anything. Oan you?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, nothing. It's all cloudy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOome on. You got to think bee, Barry.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Thinking bee.\r\n- Thinking bee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThinking bee!\r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a minute.\r\nI think I'm feeling something.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What?\r\n- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLike a 27-million-year-old instinct.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBring the nose down.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThinking bee!\r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What in the world is on the tarmac?\r\n- Get some lights on that!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThinking bee!\r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Vanessa, aim for the flower.\r\n- OK.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOut the engines. We're going in\r\non bee power. Ready, boys?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAffirmative!\r\n\r\n  \r\nGood. Good. Easy, now. That's it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLand on that flower!\r\n\r\n  \r\nReady? Full reverse!\r\n\r\n  \r\nSpin it around!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Not that flower! The other one!\r\n- Which one?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- That flower.\r\n- I'm aiming at the flower!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.\r\nI mean the giant pulsating flower\r\n\r\n  \r\nmade of millions of bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nPull forward. Nose down. Tail up.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRotate around it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- This is insane, Barry!\r\n- This's the only way I know how to fly.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAm I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane\r\nflying in an insect-like pattern?\r\n\r\n  \r\nGet your nose in there. Don't be afraid.\r\nSmell it. Full reverse!\r\n\r\n  \r\nJust drop it. Be a part of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAim for the center!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNow drop it in! Drop it in, woman!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOome on, already.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, we did it!\r\nYou taught me how to fly!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Yes. No high-five!\r\n- Right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, it worked!\r\nDid you see the giant flower?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat giant flower? Where? Of course\r\nI saw the flower! That was genius!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Thank you.\r\n- But we're not done yet.\r\n\r\n  \r\nListen, everyone!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis runway is covered\r\nwith the last pollen\r\n\r\n  \r\nfrom the last flowers\r\navailable anywhere on Earth.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat means this is our last chance.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're the only ones who make honey,\r\npollinate flowers and dress like this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf we're gonna survive as a species,\r\nthis is our moment!

It was the a wild figure of Ashton Brown.\r\n\r\nJosh gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was an admirable, sinister, beer drinker with ruddy legs and brown fingers. Her friends saw her as a magnificent, mutated monster. Once, she had even jumped into a river and saved a voiceless injured bird.\r\n\r\nBut not even an admirable person who had once jumped into a river and saved a voiceless injured bird, was prepared for what Ashton had in store today.\r\n\r\nThe drizzle rained like eating humming birds, making Josh active. Josh grabbed a squidgy blade that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.\r\n\r\nAs Josh stepped outside and Ashton came closer, she could see the cloudy glint in her eye.\r\n\r\nAshton gazed with the affection of 1022 kind cooperative cats. She said, in hushed tones, \"I love you and I want Love.\"\r\n\r\nJosh looked back, even more active and still fingering the squidgy blade. \"Ashton, I love you,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other with calm feelings, like two broad, broken blue bottles dancing at a very considerate Valentine's meal, which had indie music playing in the background and two down to earth uncles dancing to the beat.\r\n\r\nJosh regarded Ashton's pretty legs and squat fingers. \"I feel the same way!\" revealed Josh with a delighted grin.\r\n\r\nAshton looked active, her emotions blushing like a burnt, barbecued banana.\r\n\r\nThen Ashton came inside for a nice drink of beer.\r\n\r\nTHE END ","title":"Admirable Josh Khoeler","postdate":"12:59 AM on 1/22/2018 EST"},"183":{"poster":"Herronjo","content":"Everyone just stop saying they're the new owner.

That's more pollen\r\nthan you and I will see in a lifetime.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's just a status symbol.\r\nBees make too much of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it\r\nand the ladies see you wearing it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThose ladies?\r\nAren't they our cousins too?\r\n\r\n  \r\nDistant.

I try not\r\nto use the competition.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo why are you helping me?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees have good qualities.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd it takes my mind off the shop.\r\n\r\n  \r\nInstead of flowers, people\r\nare giving balloon bouquets now.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThose are great, if you're three.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd artificial flowers.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oh, those just get me psychotic!\r\n- Yeah, me too.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBent stingers, pointless pollination.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees must hate those fake things!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNothing worse\r\nthan a daffodil that's had work done.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMaybe this could make up\r\nfor it a little bit.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\r\n- I guess.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou sure you want to go through with it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAm I sure? When I'm done with\r\nthe humans, they won't be able\r\n\r\n  \r\nto say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"\r\nwithout paying a royalty!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's an incredible scene\r\nhere in downtown Manhattan,\r\n\r\n  \r\nwhere the world anxiously waits,\r\nbecause for the first time in history,\r\n\r\n  \r\nwe will hear for ourselves\r\nif a honeybee can actually speak.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's pretty big, isn't it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't believe how many humans\r\ndon't work during the day.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou think billion-dollar multinational\r\nfood companies have good lawyers?\r\n\r\n  \r\nEverybody needs to stay\r\nbehind the barricade.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What's the matter?\r\n- I don't know, I just got a chill.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, if it isn't the bee team.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou boys work on this?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll rise! The Honorable\r\nJudge Bumbleton presiding.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right.

Yes, Your Honor,\r\nwe're ready to proceed.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Montgomery,\r\nyour opening statement, please.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\r\n\r\n  \r\nmy grandmother was a simple woman.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBorn on a farm, she believed\r\nit was man's divine right\r\n\r\n  \r\nto benefit from the bounty\r\nof nature God put before us.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world\r\nMr. Benson imagines,\r\n\r\n  \r\njust think of what would it mean.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI would have to negotiate\r\nwith the silkworm\r\n\r\n  \r\nfor the elastic in my britches!\r\n\r\n  \r\nTalking bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow do we know this isn't some sort of\r\n\r\n  \r\nholographic motion-picture-capture\r\nHollywood wizardry?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey could be using laser beams!\r\n\r\n  \r\nRobotics! Ventriloquism!\r\nOloning! For all we know,\r\n\r\n  \r\nhe could be on steroids!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Benson?\r\n\r\n  \r\nLadies and gentlemen,\r\nthere's no trickery here.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm just an ordinary bee.\r\nHoney's pretty important to me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's important to all bees.\r\nWe invented it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe make it. And we protect it\r\nwith our lives.\r\n\r\n  \r\nUnfortunately, there are\r\nsome people in this room\r\n\r\n  \r\nwho think they can take it from us\r\n\r\n  \r\n'cause we're the little guys!\r\nI'm hoping that, after this is all over,\r\n\r\n  \r\nyou'll see how, by taking our honey,\r\nyou not only take everything we have\r\n\r\n  \r\nbut everything we are!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI wish he'd dress like that\r\nall the time. So nice!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOall your first witness.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\r\nof Honey Farms, big company you have.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI suppose so.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI see you also own\r\nHoneyburton and Honron!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes, they provide beekeepers\r\nfor our farms.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBeekeeper. I find that\r\nto be a very disturbing term.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't imagine you employ\r\nany bee-free-ers, do you?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- No.\r\n- I couldn't hear you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- No.\r\n- No.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBecause you don't free bees.\r\nYou keep bees. Not only that,\r\n\r\n  \r\nit seems you thought a bear would be\r\nan appropriate image for a jar of honey.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey're very lovable creatures.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou mean like this?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBears kill bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow'd you like his head crashing\r\nthrough your living room?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nBiting into your couch!\r\nSpitting out your throw pillows!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOK, that's enough. Take him away.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\r\nYour name intrigues me.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Where have I heard it before?\r\n- I was with a band called The Police.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut you've never been\r\na police officer, have you?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, I haven't.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, you haven't. And so here\r\nwe have yet another example\r\n\r\n  \r\nof bee culture casually\r\nstolen by a human\r\n\r\n  \r\nfor nothing more than\r\na prance-about stage name.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, please.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBecause I'm feeling\r\na little stung, Sting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOr should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's not his real name?! You idiots!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Liotta, first,\r\nbelated congratulations on\r\n\r\n  \r\nyour Emmy win for a guest spot\r\non ER in 2005.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThank you. Thank you.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI see from your resume\r\nthat you're devilishly handsome\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith a churning inner turmoil\r\nthat's ready to blow.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNot yet it isn't. But is this\r\nwhat it's come to for you?\r\n\r\n  \r\nExploiting tiny, helpless bees\r\nso you don't\r\n\r\n  \r\nhave to rehearse\r\nyour part and learn your lines, sir?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWatch it, Benson!\r\nI could blow right now!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis isn't a goodfella.\r\nThis is a badfella!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhy doesn't someone just step on\r\nthis creep, and we can all go home?!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Order in this court!\r\n- You're all thinking it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOrder! Order, I say!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Say it!\r\n- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think it was awfully nice\r\nof that bear to pitch in like that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think the jury's on our side.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre we doing everything right, legally?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm a florist.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight. Well, here's to a great team.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTo a great team!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, hello.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Ken!\r\n- Hello.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI didn't think you were coming.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, I was just late.\r\nI tried to call, but... the battery.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI didn't want all this to go to waste,\r\nso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, that was lucky.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere's a little left.\r\nI could heat it up.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm not much for the game myself.\r\nThe ball's a little grabby.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's where I usually sit.\r\nRight... there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\r\n\r\n  \r\nand he agreed with me that eating with\r\nchopsticks isn't really a special skill.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou think I don't see what you're doing?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know how hard it is to find\r\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDo we?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees have 100 percent employment,\r\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's just what\r\nI was thinking about doing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\r\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, you do that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook at that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, I've just about had it\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith your little mind games.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What's that?\r\n- Italian Vogue.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA lot of ads.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRemember what Van said, why is\r\nyour life more valuable than mine?\r\n\r\n  \r\nFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think something stinks in here!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI love the smell of flowers.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNot as much.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWater bug! Not taking sides!\r\n\r\n  \r\nKen, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!\r\nThis is pathetic!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI've got issues!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, well, well, a royal flush!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You're bluffing.\r\n- Am I?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSurf's up, dude!\r\n\r\n  \r\nPoo water!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat bowl is gnarly.\r\n\r\n  \r\nExcept for those dirty yellow rings!\r\n\r\n  \r\nKenneth! What are you doing?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, I don't even like honey!\r\nI don't eat it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe need to talk!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's just a little bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd he happens to be\r\nthe nicest bee I've met in a long time!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLong time? What are you talking about?!\r\nAre there other bugs in your life?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, but there are other things bugging\r\nme in life. And you're one of them!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy nerves are fried from riding\r\non this emotional roller coaster!\r\n\r\n  \r\nGoodbye, Ken.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd for your information,\r\n\r\n  \r\nI prefer sugar-free, artificial\r\nsweeteners made by man!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm sorry about all that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know it's got\r\nan aftertaste! I like it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI always felt there was some kind\r\nof barrier between Ken and me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI couldn't overcome it.\r\nOh, well.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre you OK for the trial?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI believe Mr. Montgomery\r\nis about out of ideas.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe would like to call\r\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\r\n\r\n  \r\nGood idea! You can really see why he's\r\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLayton, you've\r\ngotta weave some magic\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith this jury,\r\nor it's gonna be all over.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't worry. The only thing I have\r\nto do to turn this jury around\r\n\r\n  \r\nis to remind them\r\nof what they don't like about bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You got the tweezers?\r\n- Are you allergic?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\r\nwhat I think we'd all like to know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat exactly is your relationship\r\n\r\n  \r\nto that woman?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're friends.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Good friends?\r\n- Yes.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow good? Do you live together?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a minute...\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre you her little...\r\n\r\n  \r\n...bedbug?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI've seen a bee documentary or two.\r\nFrom what I understand,\r\n\r\n  \r\ndoesn't your queen give birth\r\nto all the bee children?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Yeah, but...\r\n- So those aren't your real parents!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oh, Barry...\r\n- Yes, they are!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHold me back!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're an illegitimate bee,\r\naren't you, Benson?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's denouncing bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't y'all date your cousins?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Objection!\r\n- I'm going to pincushion this guy!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAdam, don't!

They're striped savages!\r\n\r\n  \r\nStinging's the only thing\r\nthey know! It's their way!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Adam, stay with me.\r\n- I can't feel my legs.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat angel of mercy\r\nwill come forward to suck the poison\r\n\r\n  \r\nfrom my heaving buttocks?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI will have order in this court. Order!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOrder, please!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe case of the honeybees\r\nversus the human race\r\n\r\n  \r\ntook a pointed turn against the bees\r\n\r\n  \r\nyesterday when one of their legal\r\nteam stung Layton T.

What matters is\r\nyou're alive. You could have died.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'd be better off dead. Look at me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey got it from the cafeteria\r\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook, there's\r\na little celery still on it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat was it like to sting someone?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't explain it. It was all...\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll adrenaline and then...\r\nand then ecstasy!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou think it was all a trap?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOf course. I'm sorry.\r\nI flew us right into this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're\r\njust a couple of bugs in this world.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat will the humans do to us\r\nif they win?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\r\nThat doesn't sound so bad.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAdam, they check in,\r\nbut they don't check out!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, my.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOould you get a nurse\r\nto close that window?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Why?\r\n- The smoke.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees don't smoke.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight. Bees don't smoke.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees don't smoke!\r\nBut some bees are smoking.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's it! That's our case!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt is? It's not over?\r\n\r\n  \r\nGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.\r\n\r\n  \r\nGet back to the court and stall.\r\nStall any way you can.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Flayman.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes? Yes, Your Honor!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere is the rest of your team?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\r\n\r\n  \r\nand as a result,\r\nwe don't make very good time.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI actually heard a funny story about...\r\n\r\n  \r\nYour Honor,\r\nhaven't these ridiculous bugs\r\n\r\n  \r\ntaken up enough\r\nof this court's valuable time?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow much longer will we allow\r\nthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey have presented no compelling\r\nevidence to support their charges\r\n\r\n  \r\nagainst my clients,\r\nwho run legitimate businesses.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI move for a complete dismissal\r\nof this entire case!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going\r\n\r\n  \r\nto have to consider\r\nMr. Montgomery's motion.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut you can't!

You know what this means?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll the honey\r\nwill finally belong to the bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNow we won't have\r\nto work so hard all the time.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is an unholy perversion\r\nof the balance of nature, Benson.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou'll regret this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, how much honey is out there?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right. One at a time.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, who are you wearing?\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy sweater is Ralph Lauren,\r\nand I have no pants.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What if Montgomery's right?\r\n- What do you mean?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe've been living the bee way\r\na long time, 27 million years.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOongratulations on your victory.\r\nWhat will you demand as a settlement?\r\n\r\n  \r\nFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown\r\nof all bee work camps.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen we want back the honey\r\nthat was ours to begin with,\r\n\r\n  \r\nevery last drop.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe demand an end to the glorification\r\nof the bear as anything more\r\n\r\n  \r\nthan a filthy, smelly,\r\nbad-breath stink machine.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're all aware\r\nof what they do in the woods.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait for my signal.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTake him out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe'll have nauseous\r\nfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd we will no longer tolerate\r\nbee-negative nicknames...\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut it's just a prance-about stage name!\r\n\r\n  \r\n...unnecessary inclusion of honey\r\nin bogus health products\r\n\r\n  \r\nand la-dee-da human\r\ntea-time snack garnishments.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan't breathe.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBring it in, boys!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHold it right there! Good.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTap it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,\r\nand there's gallons more coming!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I think we need to shut down!\r\n- Shut down? We've never shut down.\r\n\r\n  \r\nShut down honey production!\r\n\r\n  \r\nStop making honey!\r\n\r\n  \r\nTurn your key, sir!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat do we do now?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOannonball!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're shutting honey production!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMission abort.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\r\nReturning to base.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAdam, you wouldn't believe\r\nhow much honey was out there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, yeah?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat's going on? Where is everybody?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Are they out celebrating?\r\n- They're home.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey don't know what to do.\r\nLaying out, sleeping in.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way\r\nto San Antonio with a cricket.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAt least we got our honey back.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSometimes I think, so what if humans\r\nliked our honey? Who wouldn't?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's the greatest thing in the world!\r\nI was excited to be part of making it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis was my new desk. This was my\r\nnew job. I wanted to do it really well.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd now...\r\n\r\n  \r\nNow I can't.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't understand\r\nwhy they're not happy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI thought their lives would be better!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey're doing nothing. It's amazing.\r\nHoney really changes people.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou don't have any idea\r\nwhat's going on, do you?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What did you want to show me?\r\n- This.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat happened here?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat is not the half of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, no. Oh, my.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey're all wilting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDoesn't look very good, does it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd whose fault do you think that is?\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, I'm gonna guess bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSpecifically, me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI didn't think bees not needing to make\r\nhoney would affect all these things.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's notjust flowers.\r\nFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's our whole SAT test right there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTake away produce, that affects\r\nthe entire animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd then, of course...\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe human species?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo if there's no more pollination,\r\n\r\n  \r\nit could all just go south here,\r\ncouldn't it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know this is also partly my fault.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow about a suicide pact?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow do we do it?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I'll sting you, you step on me.\r\n- Thatjust kills you twice.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight, right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nListen, Barry...\r\nsorry, but I gotta get going.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI had to open my mouth and talk.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa?\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa? Why are you leaving?\r\nWhere are you going?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTo the final Tournament of Roses parade\r\nin Pasadena.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey've moved it to this weekend\r\nbecause all the flowers are dying.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's the last chance\r\nI'll ever have to see it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\r\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know. Me neither.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTournament of Roses.\r\nRoses can't do sports.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a minute. Roses.

It's real.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThank you. It was a gift.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOnce inside,\r\nwe just pick the right float.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow about The Princess and the Pea?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI could be the princess,\r\nand you could be the pea!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes, I got it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Where should I sit?\r\n- What are you?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I believe I'm the pea.\r\n- The pea?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt goes under the mattresses.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\r\n- I'm getting the marshal.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou do that!\r\nThis whole parade is a fiasco!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLet's see what this baby'll do.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHey, what are you doing?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen all we do\r\nis blend in with traffic...\r\n\r\n  \r\n...without arousing suspicion.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOnce at the airport,\r\nthere's no stopping us.\r\n\r\n  \r\nStop! Security.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You and your insect pack your float?\r\n- Yes.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHas it been\r\nin your possession the entire time?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWould you remove your shoes?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Remove your stinger.\r\n- It's part of me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know. Just having some fun.\r\nEnjoy your flight.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen if we're lucky, we'll have\r\njust enough pollen to do the job.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan you believe how lucky we are? We\r\nhave just enough pollen to do the job!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think this is gonna work.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's got to work.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAttention, passengers,\r\nthis is Oaptain Scott.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe have a bit of bad weather\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt looks like we'll experience\r\na couple hours delay.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, these are cut flowers\r\nwith no water. They'll never make it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI gotta get up there\r\nand talk to them.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBe careful.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan I get help\r\nwith the Sky Mall magazine?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'd like to order the talking\r\ninflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOaptain, I'm in a real situation.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What'd you say, Hal?\r\n- Nothing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't freak out! My entire species...\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat are you doing?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!\r\n- Who's an attorney?\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't move.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, Barry.\r\n\r\n  \r\nGood afternoon, passengers.\r\nThis is your captain.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWould a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B\r\nplease report to the cockpit?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd please hurry!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat happened here?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere was a DustBuster,\r\na toupee, a life raft exploded.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOne's bald, one's in a boat,\r\nthey're both unconscious!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Is that another bee joke?\r\n- No!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo one's flying the plane!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is JFK control tower, Flight 356.\r\nWhat's your status?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is Vanessa Bloome.\r\nI'm a florist from New York.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere's the pilot?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's unconscious,\r\nand so is the copilot.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNot good. Does anyone onboard\r\nhave flight experience?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAs a matter of fact, there is.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Who's that?\r\n- Barry Benson.\r\n\r\n  \r\nFrom the honey trial?! Oh, great.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, this is nothing more\r\nthan a big metal bee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's got giant wings, huge engines.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't fly a plane.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?\r\n- Yes.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow hard could it be?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait, Barry!\r\nWe're headed into some lightning.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is Bob Bumble. We have some\r\nlate-breaking news from JFK Airport,\r\n\r\n  \r\nwhere a suspenseful scene\r\nis developing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry Benson,\r\nfresh from his legal victory...\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's Barry!\r\n\r\n  \r\n...is attempting to land a plane,\r\nloaded with people, flowers\r\n\r\n  \r\nand an incapacitated flight crew.\r\n\r\n  \r\nFlowers?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe have a storm in the area\r\nand two individuals at the controls\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith absolutely no flight experience.\r\n\r\n  \r\nJust a minute.\r\nThere's a bee on that plane.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson\r\nand his no-account compadres.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey've done enough damage.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut isn't he your only hope?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTechnically, a bee\r\nshouldn't be able to fly at all.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTheir wings are too small...\r\n\r\n  \r\nHaven't we heard this a million times?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\"The surface area of the wings\r\nand body mass make no sense.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Get this on the air!\r\n- Got it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Stand by.\r\n- We're going live.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe way we work may be a mystery to you.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMaking honey takes a lot of bees\r\ndoing a lot of small jobs.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut let me tell you about a small job.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf you do it well,\r\nit makes a big difference.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMore than we realized.\r\nTo us, to everyone.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's why I want to get bees\r\nback to working together.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's the bee way!\r\nWe're not made of Jell-O.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe get behind a fellow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Black and yellow!\r\n- Hello!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLeft, right, down, hover.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hover?\r\n- Forget hover.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis isn't so hard.\r\nBeep-beep! Beep-beep!\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, what happened?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait, I think we were\r\non autopilot the whole time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- That may have been helping me.\r\n- And now we're not!\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll of you, let's get\r\nbehind this fellow! Move it out!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMove out!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOur only chance is if I do what I'd do,\r\nyou copy me with the wings of the plane!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't have to yell.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm not yelling!\r\nWe're in a lot of trouble.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's very hard to concentrate\r\nwith that panicky tone in your voice!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's not a tone. I'm panicking!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't do this!\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, pull yourself together.\r\nYou have to snap out of it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou snap out of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou snap out of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hold it!\r\n- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow is the plane flying?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHello?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBenson, got any flowers\r\nfor a happy occasion in there?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe Pollen Jocks!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey do get behind a fellow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Black and yellow.\r\n- Hello.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right, let's drop this tin can\r\non the blacktop.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere? I can't see anything. Oan you?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, nothing. It's all cloudy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOome on. You got to think bee, Barry.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Thinking bee.\r\n- Thinking bee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThinking bee!\r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a minute.\r\nI think I'm feeling something.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What?\r\n- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLike a 27-million-year-old instinct.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBring the nose down.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThinking bee!\r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What in the world is on the tarmac?\r\n- Get some lights on that!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThinking bee!\r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Vanessa, aim for the flower.\r\n- OK.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOut the engines. We're going in\r\non bee power. Ready, boys?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAffirmative!\r\n\r\n  \r\nGood. Good. Easy, now. That's it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLand on that flower!\r\n\r\n  \r\nReady? Full reverse!\r\n\r\n  \r\nSpin it around!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Not that flower! The other one!\r\n- Which one?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- That flower.\r\n- I'm aiming at the flower!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.\r\nI mean the giant pulsating flower\r\n\r\n  \r\nmade of millions of bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nPull forward. Nose down. Tail up.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRotate around it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- This is insane, Barry!\r\n- This's the only way I know how to fly.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAm I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane\r\nflying in an insect-like pattern?\r\n\r\n  \r\nGet your nose in there. Don't be afraid.\r\nSmell it. Full reverse!\r\n\r\n  \r\nJust drop it. Be a part of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAim for the center!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNow drop it in! Drop it in, woman!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOome on, already.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, we did it!\r\nYou taught me how to fly!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Yes. No high-five!\r\n- Right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, it worked!\r\nDid you see the giant flower?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat giant flower? Where? Of course\r\nI saw the flower! That was genius!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Thank you.\r\n- But we're not done yet.\r\n\r\n  \r\nListen, everyone!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis runway is covered\r\nwith the last pollen\r\n\r\n  \r\nfrom the last flowers\r\navailable anywhere on Earth.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat means this is our last chance.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're the only ones who make honey,\r\npollinate flowers and dress like this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf we're gonna survive as a species,\r\nthis is our moment! What do you say?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre we going to be bees, orjust\r\nMuseum of Natural History keychains?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nKeychain!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen follow me!

They might not understand how to identify a noun or what theme is, but they somehow know how to make a mean plate of nachos. You learn pretty quick to not judge fish for their tree climbing ability, ya know?\r\n\r\nI thought this was the rule when I was teaching until I met Kevin. Kevin isn't his real name, but it doesn't matter because he can't spell it anyway. Kevin was a student of mine during my last year of teaching. He came to my classroom with very little to show for his academic past. He had moved a few times and thus was missing a lot of typical test scores that we use to try and ballpark their ability (Don't worry, it was a ballpark.....we didn't make major decisions until we actually had a chance to talk and work with a student for a bit.) I thought \"That's fine. I'll just do some one-on-one with Kevin and see what's up\" One on One with kevin was like conversing with someone who'd forgotten everything in a freak, if not impossible, amnesia incident. There was no evidence that he had learned anything past the 2nd grade....and now he was in 9th grade. Flabbergasted, I figured we needed to\r\n\r\n get more serious with this. If he was going to be in my class, I needed to know why and how.\r\n\r\nI decided to meet with him, his guidance counselor, his parents, and another teacher to see what was really going on. This is where it all became clear. It was by some incredible fluke that his family hadn't been wiped off the face of the Earth years ago. Odds are his entire heritage was based on blind luck and some type of sick divine intervention that saves his family every time a threat presents itself. Kevin was the genetic pinnacle of this null achievement. Even my instructional lead, a woman who could find a redeeming trait in a Balrog, failed to see any reason this kid or his family should be alive today. \r\n\r\nSo here's a list of events that made it abundantly clear that god exists and he's laughing uncontrollably:\r\n\r\n* Kevin frequently forgot when/where class was. On more than one occasion, I had to retrieve him from other classrooms.\r\n\r\n* Kevin ate an entire 24 pack of crayons, puked, and then did it again the next day. This is 9th grade. I have no idea where he got crayons.\r\n\r\n* Kevin's dad wrote tuition checks and mailed them to me...his English teacher. This was a public school. When I gave it back to Kevin, voided, to give to his dad with a brief note explaining that this is a public school, Kevin got in trouble for trying to spend it at 711 after school.\r\n\r\n* Kevin was removed from the culinary arts program after leaving a cutting board on the gas stove and starting a fire....twice\r\n\r\n* Kevin threw his lunch at the School Resource Officer and tried to run away. He ran into a door and insisted it wasn't him.\r\n\r\n* Kevin stole my phone during class. I called it. It rang. He denied that it was ringing. (Not that it wasn't his, not that he did it.....no, he denied that the phone was actually ringing). He tried it three times before the end of the year. \r\n\r\n* Kevin called the basketball coach a \"Motherfucking Bitch\" during gym. Basketball tryouts were that afternoon. Kevin tried out. It didn't go well.\r\n\r\n* Kevin's mom could never remember which school he went to. She missed several meetings because she drove to other schools (none of which he ever went to)\r\n\r\n* Kevin tazed himself in the neck before a football game\r\n\r\n* Kevin kept a bottle of orange koolaide in his backpack for about 4 months. He thought it would turn into alcohol. He drank it during homeroom and threw up.\r\n\r\n* Kevin say the N-word a lot. Kevin was white. The highschool was 84% black. Kevin got beat up a lot.\r\n\r\n* Kevin stole another student's Iphone....and tried to sell it back to them.\r\n\r\n* Kevin didn't understand that his grade was dependent on tests, quizzes, homework, classwork, and participation. Kevin finished his first semester with a 3% average. He tried to bribe me with $11.\r\n\r\n* Kevin spit on a girl and said \"You should get out of those wet clothes\". The girl was the Spanish Student Teacher.\r\n\r\n* Kevin didn't know dogs and cats were different animals.\r\n\r\n* Kevin tried to download porn onto a computer in the library.....at the circulation desk....while he was logged on.\r\n\r\n* Kevin asked a girl to prom (he was in 9th grade and freshmen don't go to prom) by asking for her phone number and then texting her his address\r\n\r\n* Kevin got gum in his hair, constantly. \r\n\r\n* Kevin regularly tried to cheat on assignments by knocking the pile over, grabbing one before I had picked them all up, and then writing it name on it wherever there was room. \r\n\r\n* Kevin had several allergies, but neither his parents nor he could remember what they were. They were very concerned that \"the holiday party\" (it's high school, we don't have those) would have peanuts. When they finally got a doctor's note....he was allergic to amoxicillin\r\n\r\n* Kevin and his parents took a trip to Nassau (how the fuck did they even get airline tickets?) and forgot all their luggage at home. I didn't believe him when he told me until I talked to him mom, who told me 1st thing when I saw her at the bi-weekly meeting.\r\n\r\n* Kevin's grandfather apparently died in a chainsaw accident. I can only assume God was looking the other way that day.","title":"Nice","postdate":"8:55 AM on 4/16/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"708":{"poster":"-Vėrso-","content":"Vote for me an I will remove ALL fake accounts.

o'clock to come by we play games and call each other names\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwarning to you guys, this is actually a beta story about how i almost fucked everything up\r\n\r\n>She starts coming over more often\r\n>I have some foam nerf swords that she discovered one day\r\n>We sword fight with those most days when she comes over\r\n>Either that or we play minecraft or CoD\r\n>our comic was still ongoing and every now and then we advance the plot\r\n>new characters etc.\r\n>She's much more creative than me\r\n>But I draw better\r\n>We make a habit out of making a competition out of everything we do\r\n>Friendly competition\r\n>Everything is screaming at me to ask her out but I just cant do it for some reason\r\n>She starts coming over every now and then\r\n>We have a lot of fun together\r\n>The swords are just about the best object I've ever owned\r\n>So much fun is had with them\r\n>You know how at the end of Monsters Inc. it was discovered that laughter was the best power source?\r\n>We could've fueled a small country for years\r\n>And as much as I want to, I cant bring myself to ask her out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>This girl has become my best, and really only, friend\r\n>Slowly, ever so slowly the walls we put up for ourselves break down\r\n>She's still happy most of the time but every now and then she needs a shoulder to cry on\r\n>I provide this shoulder\r\n>Turns out she has a lot of family drama\r\n>Thats fine with me\r\n>One day she's over at my house\r\n>She seems a bit distracted while we play CoD\r\n>Eventually after a while she sighs as if she's decided something\r\n>She pulls out a little stack of papers seemingly from nowhere\r\n>And hands them to me\r\n>She says that it's a little segment of our comic she wrote\r\n>I read it and the whole time I am Eliza looks at either the floor or the wall behind me\r\n>Dak and Ella go into some cave\r\n>Find a dungeon\r\n>Ambushed my spiders\r\n>And Dak gets his leg cut open by a skeleton's arrow\r\n>Ella ends up dragging Dak out\r\n>They're both in bad shape\r\n>Ella realizes that they may die any day\r\n>And with that in mind she kisses Dak, apparently something she's wanted to do for a long while\r\n>Hint fucking hint\r\n>I look up at Eliza and our eyes meet for a moment\r\n>Then she looks away, her face flushed\r\n>This is the part where you guys hate me /b/\r\n>I didn't pull anything\r\n>No kiss>Not even a hug\r\n>All I said was \"Pretty good.\"\r\n>She looks dissapointed\r\n>Fuck me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>So everything still continues as before\r\n>I beat myself up over then next few months\r\n>I mean what the fuck me?!\r\n>I want to be with her\r\n>So what the fuck is stopping me?\r\n>I notice that she seems less interested now\r\n>I may have missed my window\r\n>After another week I convince myself that I definitely missed my window\r\n>Fuck\r\n>We're still friends but something seems to be missing now\r\n>OP is a total betafag\r\n>Right now though i feel like an omegafag\r\n>She's given up\r\n>She thinks I'm not interested\r\n>But I am\r\n>But its too late\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>One day I read a betafag thread on 4chan\r\n>I decide to man the fuck up because you guys are pathetic and thats not how I want to be\r\n>She may have given up, but deep inside she still wants is\r\n>Fuck the consequences, I'm going in\r\n>In homeroom I tell her to come to my house on friday\r\n>She agrees\r\n>Friday rolls up\r\n>She knocks on my door\r\n>I open it and let her in\r\n>She comes upstairs with me and starts to boot up the PS3\r\n>I stop her\r\n>I'm trying to get the words out but they're stuck\r\n>Fuck my betafagness\r\n>I had finally decided to do this and now I chicken out\r\n>She's got a confused look on her face but I can make out hope behind it\r\n>No\r\n>Not again\r\n>Instead of talking I decide actions are better\r\n>Alpha impulse\r\n>I stand her up and kiss her\r\n>Like a CEO\r\n>We pull away and she looks dumbfounded\r\n>Then she goes on the offensive and kisses me\r\n>So much win\r\n\r\nShould I continue with the sex part?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n","title":"Good

The 1,000 post is getting closer and closer each day. For the user that gets the 1,000 post, I will be giving you an award. Your prize for the 1,000 post is PopCap's top Pachinko-puzzle game sequel, Peggle 2! Originally starting development around 2010-11, Peggle 2 was released in December 2013, originally supposed to launch with the release of Xbox One. It was a timed exclusive for Xbox One but was later ported to 360 around May 2014 and later PS4 in October 2014. Here are some game features listed below:\r\n\r\n• Kinect Compatibile for Xbox One!\r\n• Multiplayer Compatibile! Play up to four players online with a Peg Party match. Local matches can only go up to two players.\r\n• 60 levels and 60 trials, a total of 120 levels!\r\n• Two additional DLC can be purchased in-app for PS4 and Xbox One Users to add ten additional levels and trials.\r\n• Each master has their own soundtrack, including music themes, Fever Music, sound effects and more.\r\n• PLAYSTATION 4 Players with Dual Shock 4 Controllers will have their light on the controller light up on what color peg the ball hits.\r\n• Family friendly: You can play it in front of younger children and parents but it's rated E with Comic Mischief.\r\n\r\nContest Rules:\r\nIn order to make this fair, some rules will be put in place. If caught breaking these rules, you will not win and the post before will win.\r\n\r\n• No spam.\r\n• No alternative accounts to increase win.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to win and don't have a console or have one that's not compatible with Peggle 2, you will get the original Peggle on PC since Xbox 360 does not allow gifting and PS3 codes are no longer sold. Peggle is still on Steam however and can be gifted.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n","title":"1,000 Post Giveaway - Explained","postdate":"7:04 PM on 4/16/2018 EST","attachment":"1523919857294"},"774":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"We are in the same household and have that game on about everything in the house so 🤷 .","title":"I don't qualify for the competition or Trumps_Weave","postdate":"7:45 PM on 4/16/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"775":{"poster":"Ogelbeh","content":"validate please","title":"am i good enough","postdate":"7:56 PM on 4/16/2018 EST","attachment":"1523922992748"},"776":{"poster":"herronjo","content":"Hello","title":"Hi","postdate":"9:58 PM on 4/16/2018 EST","attachment":"1523930307828"},"777":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"Don't open!!!!!!!11111111111!!!!!!!1","title":"Bad Meme","postdate":"0:13 AM on 4/17/2018 EST","attachment":"1523938392555"},"778":{"poster":"OG_Elbow","content":"Josh whats the hold up have you forgotten or something?","title":"Edit Profile","postdate":"0:20 AM on 4/17/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"779":{"poster":"Beachball","content":"Oof ","title":"Plz stahp","postdate":"7:58 AM on 4/17/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"780":{"poster":"Beachball","content":"Hdjdjdjfjjd","title":"You should prolly try and fix this","postdate":"8:15 AM on 4/17/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"781":{"poster":"OG_Elbow","content":"Dhisisbdjd","title":"You should prolly get some more creative ideas","postdate":"8:57 AM on 4/17/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"782":{"poster":"WinRaR","content":"Why tho","title":"Spam titles?","postdate":"8:57 AM on 4/17/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"783":{"poster":"Parsecc","content":"Sniff an egg aidenyo\r\n","title":"Egg","postdate":"8:58 AM on 4/17/2018 EST","attachment":"none","edited":true},"784":{"poster":"savaka","content":"* meta\r\n* peggle\r\n* egg","title":"all that stibarc is","postdate":"9:00 AM on 4/17/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"785":{"poster":"ChrisP.Bacon","content":"Am I right, or am I right","title":"Wise words from a wise man","postdate":"9:08 AM on 4/17/2018 EST","attachment":"1523970492386"},"786":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"Yeet","title":"Grand Time","postdate":"10:12 AM on 4/17/2018 EST","attachment":"1523974319587"},"787":{"poster":"Аldeenyo","content":"I am officially resigning as president of stibarc ","title":"I resign ","postdate":"10:41 AM on 4/17/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"788":{"poster":"Bringer116","content":"Can I be the vice President?

After summer break, the phone had noticable performance drops and \"Android System\" would constantly eat up the battery. I've factory reset the phone, removed AT&T's bloaty firmware with the unlocked models software and other online methods.\r\n\r\nAs each day passes, new problems pop up. After going back to AT&T software to prepare for a trade in for my birthday, the heart rate sensor now randomly flashes with it's bright red laser light. It does it when touched, even in my pockets and a desk. The phone also says the \"flashlight is running via camera\" but even when force stopping all camera related apps and even restarting the phone, the problem still exists. The Samsung camera app also crashes whenever I want to take a picture or record a video of a cool chemistry lab we have been doing in Science. Attached below is what uses the battery most. Turning off Bluetooth, GPS, and even airplane mode is not helping either. \r\n\r\nWhat are some possible ideas you all have to improve battery life? \r\n\r\nShould I really get a new phone because of this issue?\r\n\r\nIf I do get a new phone, what phone should I get??

We don't have any pizza boxes that will fit this 71 Domino's one topping pizza topping pizza.\" So you say, \"Hold on,\" And quickly run to Home Depot and purchase a Maytag refrigerator which retails for 3,399 US dollars, and when it comes time to pay for the Maytag refrigerator, you offer to pay Home Depot, not with cash, but with 70 piping hot Domino's one topping pizzas, and they of course accept, so you buy the fridge and you take it back to the Domino's Pizzeria Restaurant, you give the pizza guy a Maytag refrigerator box and put the 71 topped Domino's Pizza one topping pizza into that, and then you pay Domino's using a brand new Maytag refrigerator which retails for 3,399 US dollars, so then you take the Maytag refrigerator box filled with a 71 topped Domino's one topping pizza back to Home Depot, and you give it to the cashier there as payment for your brand new Maytag refrigerator which retails for 3,399 US dollars, and when the cashier turns his back to get your receipt, you snatch the 71st Domino's one topping pizza off the top of your Domino's one topping pizza stack and you put it in your pocket, and there you have yourself a completely free steaming hot Domino's one topping pizza!","title":"Free Domino's Pizza *for free*","postdate":"0:35 PM on 7/10/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"1357":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"Windows detected my grandparents slow WiFi speed and automatically assumed it is a metered network.","title":"My WiFi is a metered connection?!","postdate":"8:31 PM on 7/10/2018 EST","attachment":"1531269018998"},"1358":{"poster":"savaka","content":"you can now use the new api feature to load recent posts from longer ago","title":"scratch extension updated","postdate":"3:10 PM on 7/11/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"1359":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"Conk","title":"Conk","postdate":"7:20 PM on 7/11/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"1360":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"Those ahead or behind are gay","title":"4:20","postdate":"7:21 PM on 7/11/2018 EST","attachment":"1531351265421"},"1361":{"poster":"herronjo","content":"This is a test of something.","title":"Test","postdate":"11:02 AM on 7/12/2018 EST","attachment":"1531407710324"},"1362":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"🅱️epsi","title":"🅱️epsi","postdate":"6:28 PM on 7/12/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"1363":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"🅿️🅿️","title":"🅿️🅿️","postdate":"11:12 PM on 7/12/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"1364":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"Dr. 🅱️epper","title":"Dr. 🅱️epper","postdate":"2:25 PM on 7/13/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"1365":{"poster":"savaka","content":"you: donuts\r\nme, an intellectual:","title":"idk what to title this","postdate":"5:52 PM on 7/13/2018 EST","attachment":"1531518668708"},"1366":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"Grandfather: did you order that stove top grill on amazon hon?\r\n\r\nGrandmother: 🤔 what grill\r\n\r\nGrandfather: a grill was ordered under your name.\r\n\r\nGrandmother: Can’t remember ordering it.\r\n\r\nGrandfather: oh right, I was looking at stove grills on amazon on my smartphone and tapped “buy now” to see what would happen.","title":"Accidental purchase of stove top grill","postdate":"1:42 AM on 7/14/2018 EST","attachment":"1531546868082"},"1367":{"poster":"savaka","content":"hackers gonna intercept connection to my own internal storage drive","title":"security","postdate":"4:59 PM on 7/14/2018 EST","attachment":"1531601945806"},"1368":{"poster":"savaka","content":"this is how i eat meal\r\nit works for breakfast, lunch, or dinner\r\n\r\n1x bagel (whole bagel, any size, not toasted)\r\n1x (or 2x) cheese\r\n1x juice (preferably orange colored)\r\n1x yogurt (optional)\r\n2x (or more) cookie","title":"how to make meal","postdate":"6:19 PM on 7/14/2018 EST","attachment":"none","edited":true},"1369":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"Edna has a few tips for you.","title":"Tip from Edna Mode","postdate":"6:27 PM on 7/14/2018 EST","attachment":"1531607236431"},"1370":{"poster":"ModernFeelGames","content":"&shy","title":"Ro🅱️lox","postdate":"7:31 AM on 7/15/2018 EST","attachment":"none","edited":true},"1371":{"poster":"ModernFeelGames","content":"Meem","title":"Meme","postdate":"7:51 AM on 7/15/2018 EST","attachment":"1531655284073"},"1372":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"How the egg ended up there is a huge story.","title":"Egg...in...Spaaaace!","postdate":"2:16 PM on 7/15/2018 EST","attachment":"1531678587228"},"1373":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"I hope this is one thing we all can agree on. \r\n\r\nSeriously \r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"Ban K-Pop?","postdate":"5:44 AM on 7/16/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"1374":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"SOMEONE IS HOLDING MY EGGS IN HOSTAGE, I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THEM!\r\n\r\n🥚🔫\r\n\r\nNO DO NOT DO THIS TO MY EGGS\r\n\r\n🥚🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫\r\n\r\nNOOOOOOO\r\n\r\n🥚💥 🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫\r\n\r\n🤯 NOOOOOO, MY EGGS. \r\n\r\n🍳 \r\n\r\nITS RUINED.

Lee, designed by William Porcher Miles. (The white fringe is often omitted.)\r\n\r\nA rectangular variant without fringe, common in modern reproductions. (A similar flag was used during the war by the Army of Tennessee under General Joseph E. Johnston. A lighter colored version was used as the second naval jack.)\r\nThe display of flags used by and associated with the Confederate States of America (1861–1865) has continued, with a long interruption, into the present day, with the \"Southern cross\" used in the battle flag of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia gaining the most popular recognition as a modern symbol of the Confederacy, and by extension, the Southern United States in general. Such displays have been made for a variety of reasons, with Southern heritage, states' rights, and historical commemoration among the stated reasons for particular uses. Displaying the flag has long been controversial in the United States, due to the flag's longstanding associations with treason, racism, slavery, segregation, and white supremacy.[1][2][3] Southerners associate the Confederate battle flag with pride in their heritage and traditions, but it is impossible to separate the flag from its association with the defense of slavery and racial bias.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nConfederate flags at showing of Gone with the Wind on Lincoln's Birthday, 1940, Winchester, Virginia\r\nDespite the common belief that \"the Confederate flag\" has remained in uninterrupted use since the end of the American Civil War, its use was mostly limited to historical films, like Gone with the Wind (1939). Its revival in the 1950s and 1960s came about because of the American Civil War Centennial, but was also used to show opposition to the Civil Rights Movement, starting with Senator Strom Thurmond's Dixiecrats in 1948. Racism played a major role in its renewed popularity.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n1\tBackground\r\n2\tThe vernacular \"Confederate flag\"\r\n3\tRevival and controversy\r\n3.1\tUnofficial military use\r\n3.2\tPolitical groups\r\n3.3\tReligious groups\r\n3.4\tPublic opinion (2011-2015)\r\n3.5\tHistorical and modern meaning\r\n3.6\tPopularity outside the southern U.S.\r\n3.7\tIn film and television\r\n3.8\tUse by musicians\r\n3.9\tUniversity of Mississippi statue\r\n3.10\tHouse bill banning flag at VA cemeteries\r\n3.11\tSix Flags Over Texas\r\n3.12\tDisplay at American University\r\n4\tOfficial usage in southern U.S. states\r\n4.1\tState flags\r\n4.2\tState symbol\r\n4.3\tState seals\r\n4.4\tVehicle license plates\r\n4.5\tDisplay at South Carolina State Capitol\r\n5\tReactions to 2015 Charleston church shooting\r\n5.1\tRemoval from South Carolina State Capitol\r\n5.2\tRetailer bans\r\n5.3\tNASCAR\r\n5.4\tWashington National Cathedral\r\n6\tTrump rallies\r\n7\tDisplay in South Carolina vandalized\r\n8\tSee also\r\n9\tFurther reading\r\n10\tReferences\r\nBackground\r\nThe three flag designs used by the Confederate States of America\r\n\r\n1861–63\r\n\r\n1863–65\r\n\r\n1865\r\nMain article: Flags of the Confederate States of America\r\nThe Confederate States of America (CSA) originally used three national flags during the American Civil War. The latter two incorporated the \"Southern cross\" canton that was widely recognized as a symbol of the Confederacy by 1863.\r\n\r\nThe vernacular \"Confederate flag\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1896 lithograph of the three Confederate national flags and the battle flag\r\nDesigned by William Porcher Miles, the chairman of the Flag and Seal Committee of the Confederate Provisional Congress, the flag now generally known as the \"Confederate flag\" was initially proposed, and rejected, as the national flag in 1861. The design was instead adopted as a battle flag by the Army of Northern Virginia (ANV) under General Robert E. Lee.[6]\r\n\r\nMost popular today is a rectangularized variant of the originally square ANV battle flag, common in modern reproductions. (A similarly rectangular flag was used during the war by the Army of Tennessee under General Joseph E. Johnston.[7][8]) Despite never having historically represented the Confederacy as a country nor been officially recognized as one of its flags, it is commonly referred to as \"the Confederate Flag\" and has become a widely recognized symbol of the American South.[9] It is also known as the \"rebel flag\", \"Dixie flag\", \"the Confederate battle flag\", and \"Southern cross\", and is often incorrectly referred to as the \"Stars and Bars\".[10] (The actual \"Stars and Bars\" is the first national flag of the Confederacy, which used an entirely different design.) The self-declared Confederate exclave of Town Line, New York, lacking a genuine Confederate flag, flew a version of this flag prior to its 1946 vote to ceremonially rejoin the Union.\r\n\r\nRevival and controversy\r\nSee also: Lost Cause of the Confederacy § Twentieth and twenty-first century usage; Allen Central High School § Mascot and flag scandals; and Lexington, Virginia § Flag controversy\r\nConfederate soldiers were not familiar with the modern flag as such, but many were fond of the flags of their own units. These often included design elements found on the modern Confederate flag. They honored battlefield comradery rather than Southern nationalism. During the \"memorial period\" that ran from the late 19th century through the 1920s, use of Confederate flags broadened and they became the symbolic embodiment of the Lost Cause.[11] The Confederate battle flag was added to the state flag of Mississippi in 1894 and appeared on two former state flags of Georgia from 1956 until 2003.[12] The 50th anniversary reunion at Gettysburg in 1913 was a turning point in obtaining national acceptance of the flag and other Confederate symbols. The flag appears prominently in Birth of a Nation (1915). The second Ku Klux Klan (1915–1944), a group inspired by this film, was a nativist organization that flew the U.S. flag exclusively. Margaret Mitchell's novel, Gone with the Wind, led to a brief but intense period of nostalgia for the Old South during which the Confederate flag appeared widely.[13] In the film adaptation, the flag flutters over a scene of vast carnage.\r\n\r\nUnofficial military use\r\nDuring World War II some U.S. military units with Southern nicknames, or made up largely of Southerners, made the flag their unofficial emblem. The USS Columbia flew a Confederate Navy Ensign as a battle flag throughout combat in the South Pacific in World War II. This was done in honor of Columbia, the ship's namesake and the capital city of South Carolina, the first state to secede from the Union. Some soldiers carried Confederate flags into battle. After the Battle of Okinawa a Confederate flag was raised over Shuri Castle by a Marine from the self-styled \"Rebel Company\" (Company A of the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines). It was visible for miles and was taken down after three days on the orders of General Simon B. Buckner, Jr. (son of Confederate general Simon Buckner, Sr.), who stated that it was inappropriate as \"Americans from all over are involved in this battle\". It was replaced with the regulation, 48-star flag of the United States.[14] By the end of World War II, the use of the Confederate flag in the military was rare.[15]\r\n\r\nPolitical groups\r\nThe 1948 Dixiecrat political party extensively used Confederate symbols, including the battle flag, and contributed to the flag's post-World War II re-popularization.[16] According to historian John Coski, segregationists utilized Confederate symbols since both they and the Confederates had similar goals, that is, opposition to any \"change the South's racial status quo.\" As a result, Coski stated that \"There could be no more fitting opposition\" to desegregation \"than the Confederate battle flag. Although segregationists lost their battle and their cause was discredited, attitudes of white supremacy live on.\"[17]\r\n\r\nIn Georgia, the Confederate battle flag was reintroduced as an element of the state flag in 1956, just two years after the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education. It was considered by many to be a protest against school desegregation.[18] It was also raised at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) during protests against integration of schools.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers of the Detroit-based National Socialist Movement marching at Market Square in Knoxville, Tennessee - 14 August 2010\r\nSupporters of the flag's continued use claim it is a symbol of Southern ancestry and heritage as well as representing a distinct and independent cultural tradition of the Southern United States from the rest of the country. Some groups use the \"southern cross\" as one of the symbols associated with their organizations, including groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.[20] However, the flag of the United States is commonly used instead. For other supporters, the Confederate flag represents only a past era of Southern sovereignty.[21] As the public display of Nazi flags (or any other flags) is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech[22], the Nazi Reichskriegsflagge has also been seen on display at white supremacist events within United States borders, side-by-side with the Confederate flag,[23]\r\n\r\nHistorian John Coski noted that the Sons of Confederate Veterans, the \"most visible, active, and effective defender of the flag\", \"carried forward into the twenty-first century, virtually unchanged, the Lost Cause historical interpretations and ideological vision formulated at the turn of the twentieth.\"[24] Coski wrote concerning \"the flag wars of the late twentieth century\":\r\n\r\nFrom the ... early 1950s, SCV officials defended the integrity of the battle flag against trivialization and against those who insisted that its display was unpatriotic or racist. SCV spokesmen reiterated the consistent argument that the South fought a legitimate war for independence, not a war to defend slavery, and that the ascendant \"Yankee\" view of history falsely vilified the South and led people to misinterpret the battle flag.[25]\r\n\r\nThe allied United Daughters of the Confederacy and other historical societies also used the flag as part of their symbols.\r\n\r\nFrom a very different political perspective, both the Southern Student Organizing Committee and the Young Patriots Organization (the latter among Southern migrants in Chicago), were 1960/70s New Left anti-racist movements that attempted to reappropriate the Confederate flag in their symbolism.\r\n\r\nReligious groups\r\nIn 2016 the Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution at their annual meeting calling for Southern Baptist churches to stop displaying the Confederate flag, as a \"sign of solidarity of the whole Body of Christ.\"[26]\r\n\r\nPublic opinion (2011-2015)\r\nThe Confederate flag is a controversial symbol for many Americans today. A 2011 Pew Research Center poll revealed that 30% of Americans had a \"negative reaction\" when \"they saw the Confederate flag displayed.\"[27] According to the same poll, 9% of Americans had a positive reaction. A majority (58%) had no reaction. Among black Americans, 41% had a negative reaction, 10% had a positive reaction and 45% had no reaction. A similar poll taken in 2015 revealed little change from 2011.[28]\r\n\r\nIn an October 2013 YouGov poll, a plurality (38%) of those polled disapproved of displaying the flag in public places.[29] In the same poll, a plurality (44%) of those asked viewed the flag as a symbol of racism, with 24% viewing it as exclusively racist and 20% viewing it as both racist and symbolic of pride in the region.[29]\r\n\r\nIn a national survey in 2015 across all races, 57% of Americans had the opinion that the Confederate flag represented Southern pride rather than racism. A similar poll in 2000 had a nearly identical result of 59%. However, poll results from only the South yielded a completely different result. 75% of Southern whites described the flag as a symbol of pride, while, conversely, 75% of Southern blacks said the flag symbolized racism.[30]\r\n\r\nHistorical and modern meaning\r\n\r\nConfederate flag made out of flowers at the Confederate Statue in Jasper, Alabama. 2010\r\nAs a result of these varying perceptions, there have been a number of political controversies surrounding the use of the Confederate battle flag in Southern state flags, at sporting events, at Southern universities, and on public buildings.[31] In their study of Confederate symbols in the contemporary Southern United States, the Southern political scientists James Michael Martinez, William Donald Richardson, and Ron McNinch-Su wrote:\r\n\r\nThe battle flag was never adopted by the Confederate Congress, never flew over any state capitols during the Confederacy, and was never officially used by Confederate veterans' groups. The flag probably would have been relegated to Civil War museums if it had not been resurrected by the resurgent KKK and used by Southern Dixiecrats during the 1948 presidential election.[32]\r\n\r\nSouthern historian Gordon Rhea further wrote in 2011 that:\r\n\r\nIt is no accident that Confederate symbols have been the mainstay of white supremacist organizations, from the Ku Klux Klan to the skinheads. They did not appropriate the Confederate battle flag simply because it was pretty. They picked it because it was the flag of a nation dedicated to their ideals: 'that the negro is not equal to the white man'. The Confederate flag, we are told, represents heritage, not hate. But why should we celebrate a heritage grounded in hate, a heritage whose self-avowed reason for existence was the exploitation and debasement of a sizeable segment of its population?[33]\r\n\r\nSymbols of the Confederacy remain a contentious issue across the United States and their civic placement has been debated vigorously in many southern U.S. state legislatures since the early 1990s, such as the effort that led to the replacement of Georgia's flag in 2001.[34] Supporters have labeled attempts to display the flag as an exercise of free speech in response to bans in some schools and universities, but have not always been successful in court[35] when attempting to use this justification.\r\n\r\nPopularity outside the southern U.S.\r\nThe flag has found some popularity in places far outside of the former Confederacy, especially in rural areas in the United States.[36]\r\n\r\nPacific Northwest\r\nWhen researching his ethnography of whites, Searching for Whitopia, scholar Rich Benjamin kept a notepad while traveling the Pacific Northwest. \"I remember driving through swaths of Washington and Oregon and seeing a lot of Confederate flags,\" Benjamin explained to journalist Matthew Novak. \"There are a lot of refugees from the South who seem attracted to Oregon not because they're racists, but because Oregon has a racial homogeneity and a conservatism and a gun culture that they really appreciate.\" The Pacific Northwest offers a cultural collision between the Confederate flag, other emblems of racism, and its new technological profit hubs.[37]\r\n\r\n\r\n3rd Flag of the Confederacy and the Bonny Blue Flag at Jefferson Davis Park, Washington, 2018\r\nCalls for the removal of Confederate flags from Jefferson Davis Park in southwestern Washington State began in 2015, after the Charleston church shooting, by Rev. Marva Edwards, the president of Vancouver's NAACP chapter.[38] [39] Even though the markers and flags are located on private property, they are and were intended to be highly visible (to all cars travelling Interstate 5). Their visibility, and events in other parts of the nation regarding Confederate memorials, still make these symbols a local focus of strong emotions, especially in the aftermath of the white nationalist Unite the Right rally August 11–12, 2017.[40][41]\r\n\r\nAt European far-right events\r\nIn a \"limited\" degree of reciprocity with its use beside the First Amendment-protected display of Nazi flags at far-right events within the United States, there has increasingly been seen at far-right group gatherings within some European nations' borders, the use of the rectangular \"rebel flag\" form of the Confederate naval jack, in place of often-banned Third Reich flags.[42]\r\n\r\nIn film and television\r\nThe 1979–1985 American television series The Dukes of Hazzard, set in a fictional Georgia county, featured the General Lee stock car with the flag prominently painted over its roof throughout the series' run.\r\n\r\nUse by musicians\r\nThe Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd made heavy use of the flag. They tried distancing themselves from it because of its racial connotations in 2012,[43] but then resumed using it that same year.[44]\r\n\r\nMetal band Pantera sold numerous items in their official online store that featured the flag until July 2015.[45] Founding member Dimebag Darrell, who was shot and killed in 2004, used a Dean ML guitar customized with the flag covering the guitar's body. As of July 2015, singer Phil Anselmo distanced himself from usage of the flag.[46]\r\n\r\nHip-hop group Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz used the flag on the cover of their 2001 album Put Yo Hood Up, as well as in the music video for their single \"Bia' Bia'\".[47]\r\n\r\nUniversity of Mississippi statue\r\nOn February 16, 2014, University of Mississippi campus police discovered the James Meredith memorial statue, erected in October 2006, surrounded with pre-2003 Georgia State Flags (containing the Confederate Flag) and a rope tied into a noose around the neck of the statue. Meredith, an alumnus of the University of Mississippi, was, in October 1962, the first African American to attend the school.[48] The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Oxford, Mississippi Police Department conducted an investigation shortly after the event which led to the arrest of Graeme Phillip Harris, a former freshman at the university. Harris pleaded guilty in June 2015 to a misdemeanor for using threat of force to intimidate African-American students and employees. U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills sentenced Harris to six months in prison, followed by twelve months of supervision after release.[49] A second student, Austin Reed Edenfield, 21, was sentenced to a year of probation in addition to 50 hours of community service.[50] A third student has yet to be charged.[51]\r\n\r\nHouse bill banning flag at VA cemeteries\r\nOn May 19, 2016, the United States House of Representatives voted to ban the display of Confederate flags on flagpoles at Veterans Administration cemeteries, by a 265-159 vote. The ban was contained in an amendment (House Amendment 592, 114th Congress) to House bill 2822, an appropriations bill.[52] The author of the amendment was California congressman Jared Huffman, who stated that the flag represented \"racism, slavery and division.\"[53][54]\r\n\r\nIn June 2016, Republicans in Congress attempted to attach an amendment to a bill funding the fight against the Zika virus epidemic that would have reversed the flag ban. It was just one provision of several that Republicans had attached, including an amendment cutting Planned Parenthood funding. Senate Democrats blocked the bill through filibuster.[55][56]\r\n\r\nSix Flags Over Texas\r\nOn August 2017, in response to the controversial Unite the Right rally that was held in Charlottesville, the park Six Flags Over Texas replaced their six flags (which had included the Confederate flag) with six American flags. A representative of the park told KXAS-TV, \"We always choose to focus on celebrating the things that unite us versus those that divide us. As such, we have changed the flag displays in our park to feature American flags.\"[57]\r\n\r\nDisplay at American University\r\nOn September 27, 2017, ten Confederate flag posters bearing chunks of cotton were found on the campus of American University.\r\n\r\nThe date coincided with the presentation by historian Ibram Kendi to introduce the Antiracist Research and Policy Center.\r\n\r\nOfficial usage in southern U.S. states\r\nIn the years after the end of the American Civil War, many former slave states that were members of the Confederacy during the war adopted new state flags. Incorporating in their new flags' designs were motifs that were used in the Confederacy's flags, such as the St. Andrew's cross. In the case of Mississippi, Florida, and Alabama, these new state flags were adopted around the same time that new Jim Crow segregation laws were being enacted. These laws, combined with poll taxes, literacy tests, and extrajudicial violence such as lynchings, disenfranchised African American voters for the next several decades.[58] According to historian John M. Coski:\r\n\r\nThe flag changes in Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida coincided with the passage of formal Jim Crow segregation laws throughout the South. Four years before Mississippi incorporated a Confederate battle flag into its state flag, its constitutional convention passed pioneering provisions to 'reform' politics by effectively disenfranchising most African Americans.\r\n\r\n— John M. Coski, The Confederate Battle Flag: America's Most Embattled Emblem (2005), pp. 80–81.[58]\r\nState flags\r\nAlabama\r\nMain article: Flag of Alabama\r\n\r\nFlag of Alabama\r\n\r\nFlag of Spain used in Alabama and Florida until the 1800s\r\nThough state legislation described the flag of Alabama as being based on the design of St. Andrew's Cross,[59] it has been hypothesized that the crimson saltire of the flag was designed to resemble the blue saltire of the Confederate Battle Flag. The legislation that created the state flag did not specify if the flag was going to be square or rectangular.[60] The authors of a 1917 article in National Geographic expressed their opinion that because the Alabama flag was based on the Battle Flag, it should be square.[61] In 1987, the office of Alabama Attorney General Don Siegelman issued an opinion in which the Battle Flag derivation is repeated, but concluded that the proper shape is rectangular, as it had been depicted numerous times in official publications and reproductions.[62]\r\n\r\n\r\nFlag of Montgomery, Alabama, design reminiscent of the Confederate Battle Flag and gray uniforms.\r\nAnother slim possibility is in the flag of Co. F 7th Regiment Alabama Cavalry. The regiment was the only Alabama regiment in Rucker's Brigade commanded by Col. Edmund Rucker of Tennessee, later Alabama, who became a prominent Montgomery businessman after the war. The flag of the brigade used a white background with a red saltire which did not always extend to the corners and charged with dark colored stars upon the saltire. The flag of Co. F, 7th Alabama Cavalry is currently held by the Alabama Department of Archives and History as part of its Alabama Civil War Period Flag Collection.[63] But, the flag carried by Co. F 7th Alabama was not an Alabama Flag, it was the flag made for Rucker's Brigade a month before the 7th joined his brigade; the 7th was color party only after September 24, 1864. A bunting flag that exists, in the white and red configuration with 13 blue stars, is not believed to be Alabama associated, but tied to Rucker's Brigade.\r\n\r\nArkansas\r\nMain article: Flag of Arkansas\r\n\r\nFlag of Arkansas\r\nThe flag of Arkansas contains a 4 blue stars within a diamond representing the 4 countries that historically controlled the territory, one of these stars represents the Confederate States of America. [64][65] The design of the border around the white diamond evokes the saltire found on the Confederate battle flag.[66]\r\n\r\nFlorida\r\n\r\nFlag of Florida\r\nMain article: Flag of Florida\r\nThe current flag of Florida, adopted by popular referendum in 1900, with minor changes in 1985, contains the St. Andrew's Cross. It is believed that the Cross was added in memory of, and showing support for, the Confederacy.[67][68] The addition of the Cross was proposed by Governor Francis P. Fleming, a former Confederate soldier, who was strongly committed to racial segregation.\r\n\r\nGeorgia\r\nMain article: Flag of Georgia (U.S. state)\r\n\r\nFlag of Trenton, Georgia\r\n\r\nThe current state flag of Georgia, adopted in 2003. It is based on the Confederacy's first national flag, the \"Stars and Bars\".\r\nIn 1956 the Georgian state flag was redesigned to incorporate the Confederate battle flag. Following protests over this aspect of the design in the 1990s by the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and other groups, efforts began in the Georgia General Assembly to remove the battle flag from the state flag's design. These efforts succeeded in January 2001 when Georgia Governor Roy Barnes introduced a design that, though continuing to depict the Battle Flag, greatly reduced its prominence.\r\n\r\nThe following year, amidst dwindling demands for the return of the 1956 design (\"Battle Flag\" version) and lesser opposing demands for the continued use of the new \"Barnes'\" design, the Georgia General Assembly redesigned the flag yet again; it adopted a \"compromise\" design using the 13-star First National Flag of the Confederacy (the \"Stars and Bars\"), combined with a simplified version of Georgia's state seal placed within the circle of 13 stars on the flag's canton.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent flags of Georgia\r\nMississippi\r\nMain article: Flag of Mississippi\r\n\r\nFlag of Mississippi\r\nThe Confederate battle flag became a part of the flag of Mississippi in 1894. In 1906 the flag statutes were omitted by error from the new legal code of the state, leaving Mississippi without an official flag. The omission was not discovered until 1993, when a lawsuit filed by the NAACP regarding the flag was being reviewed by the Supreme Court of Mississippi. In 2000 Governor Ronnie Musgrove issued an executive order making the flag official, which it did in February 2001. After continued controversy, the decision was turned over to citizens of the state, who, on April 17, 2001, voted 2:1 to keep the Confederate Battle Flag a part of the current state flag.[69]\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi flag, containing the Confederate battle flag, is included on campaign signs of the State Senator Chris McDaniel, whose signature issue is a promise to preserve the state flag.[70]\r\n\r\nFollowing the Charleston church shooting in June 2015 and subsequent discussion of the flying of the Confederate Battle Flag at the South Carolina State House, Speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives Philip Gunn publicly called for the removal of the Confederate Battle Flag from the flag of Mississippi.[71]\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina\r\nMain article: Flag of North Carolina\r\n\r\nFlag of North Carolina\r\nThe present form, a variant of the confederate's war flag, dates back to 1885 and bears the initials of the federal state. The red field of the old flag was replaced by blue, as a reminder of the Bonnie Blue Flag, which was used as a symbol of secession during the war.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nState symbol\r\nStone Mountain, Georgia is a \"monument to the Confederacy\"[72] that was paid for and is owned by the state of Georgia. Stone Mountain Park opened 100 years to the day after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.[73] It is the most visited destination in the state of Georgia.[72]\r\n\r\nFour flags of the Confederacy are flown at Stone Mountain.[74] In addition, the Stone Mountain Memorial Lawn \"contains...thirteen terraces — one for each Confederate state.... Each terrace flies the flag that the state flew as member of the Confederacy.\"[75]\r\n\r\nState seals\r\nSee also: Six flags over Texas\r\nThe first Confederate flag, together with five other nations that have had sovereignty over Texas (Spain, France, Mexico, Republic of Texas, United States) appear (tiles) above one of the side entrances to the Capitol. They also appear on the reverse of the Seal of Texas, which is the subject of a floor mosaic in the Capitol Extension. The reverse of the seal was proposed by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas and approved by the Texas Legislature and Governor in 1961, modified in 1991.[76]\r\n\r\nThe Alabamian coat of arms features the Confederate battle flag's saltire in its design. Similar to Texas, the saltire on the coat of arms represents one of the five countries which have held sovereignty over part or all of Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe shield of the Confederacy was found in the Rotunda of the Florida Capitol, together with those of France, Spain, Great Britain, and the United States – all of them treated equally as \"nations\" that Florida was part of or governed by. The five flags \"that have flown in Florida\" were included on the official Senate seal, displayed prominently in the Senate chambers, on its stationery, and throughout the Capitol. On October 19, 2015, the Senate agreed to change the seal so as to remove the Confederate battle flag from it.[77] The new (2016) Senate seal has only the flags of the United States and Florida.[78]\r\n\r\nVehicle license plates\r\nIn Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, vehicle owners can request a state-issued license plate featuring the Sons of Confederate Veterans logo, which incorporates the square Confederate battle flag.[79]\r\n\r\nIn 1998, a North Carolina appellate court upheld the issuance of such license plates in the case Sons of Confederate v. DMV, noting: \"We are aware of the sensitivity of many of our citizens to the display of the Confederate flag. Whether the display of the Confederate flag on state-issued license plates represents sound public policy is not an issue presented to this Court in this case. That is an issue for our General Assembly.\"[80]\r\n\r\nIn 2015, the dispute over Texas vanity plates that would have displayed the logo ended up before the United States Supreme Court.[81] In its decision in Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, the court ruled that license plates are governmental speech, so the government may decide what to have printed on them. Texas's refusal to issue flag-emblazoned license plates therefore didn't violate petitioners' right to free speech.[82]\r\n\r\nIn 2015, Virginia recalled its vanity plates with the Confederate flag emblem pictured within the logo of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.[83] To holders of SCV plates, the state mailed replacements without the emblem. The old design with the emblem was invalidated and driving with such Virginia tags was made a misdemeanor similar to driving an unlicensed vehicle, though in October 2015 a SCV legal team tried fighting the ban in court.[83]\r\n\r\nDisplay at South Carolina State Capitol\r\nThe flag flying at the South Carolina Confederate Monument in Columbia, SC\r\nThe flag flying at the South Carolina Confederate Monument in Columbia, South Carolina\r\nView of the South Carolina State House with the Confederate Monument in front\r\nView of the South Carolina State House with the Confederate Monument in front\r\nThe Confederate battle flag was raised over the State House on April 11, 1961 at the request of Representative John May,[citation needed] ostensibly as a part of opening celebrations of the Confederate War Centennial, according to Dr. Daniel Hollis, an appointed member of the centennial commission. Many historians point out that the appearance of the flag likely had a more nefarious purpose: to symbolize Southern defiance in the face of a burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. In March 1962, lawmakers passed a resolution directing the flag be flown over the State House.[84][85][86] As Time magazine later noted, the move was \"a states’-rights rebuff to desegregation.\"[87]\r\n\r\nOn April 12, 2000, the South Carolina State Senate passed a bill to remove the Confederate flag from the top of the State House dome by a majority vote of 36 to 7.[88] \"...[T]he new bill specified that a more traditional version of the battle flag would be flown in front of the Capitol next to a monument honoring fallen Confederate soldiers.\" The bill also passed the state's House of Representatives, but not without some difficulty. On May 18, 2000, after the bill was modified to ensure that the height of the flag's new pole would be 30 feet (9 m), it was passed by a majority of 66 to 43.[89] Governor Jim Hodges signed the bill into law five days later after it passed the state Senate. On July 1, 2000 the flag was removed from atop the State House by two students (one white and one black) from The Citadel; a more historically accurate Confederate battle flag was then raised on a 30-foot pole on the front lawn of the Capitol next to a slightly taller monument honoring Confederate soldiers[90] who died during the Civil War. State law prohibited the flag's removal from the State House grounds without additional legislation.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, two Western Carolina University researchers found that 74% of African-Americans polled favored removing the flag from the State House altogether.[91] The NAACP and other civil rights groups attacked the flag's continued presence at the state capitol. The NAACP maintained an official economic boycott of South Carolina for 15 years, citing the state's continued display of the battle flag, until the flag was eventually removed completely from the State House grounds.[92][93]\r\n\r\nIn 2000, the National Collegiate Athletic Association \"announced that it will cancel future Association-sponsored events in South Carolina if that state doesn't take action to remove the Confederate battle flag from atop its state capitol.\" The association said that \"many coaches and student-athletes feel that an inhospitable environment is created by the display of the Confederate flag over the South Carolina state house\", and its chair said \"there is no question that to a significant number of our constituents, the flag is a symbol of oppression.\" This has prevented South Carolina from hosting any championship sporting events in which the sites are determined in advance.[94] This NCAA ban on post-season championships in South Carolina has been strictly enforced, with the exception of HBCU Benedict College. In both 2007 and 2009, the school hosted the post-season Pioneer Bowl game, in violation of the NCAA ban, though no action was taken.[95] On April 14, 2007, Steve Spurrier, coach of the University of South Carolina football team, made an acceptance speech for a community service award in which he referred to the flag on the State House grounds as \"that damn flag.\" This statement was also inspired by the actions of, as Spurrier said, \"some clown\" who waved the battle flag while being videotaped for SportsCenter.[96] On July 6, 2009, the Atlantic Coast Conference announced a decision to move three future baseball tournaments out of South Carolina citing miscommunications with the NAACP concerning the display of the Confederate flag in the state.[97]\r\n\r\nThe flag was removed in 2015 in the wake of the Charleston church shooting.\r\n\r\nReactions to 2015 Charleston church shooting\r\nSee also: Charleston church shooting\r\nOn June 18, the day after a deadly church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina perpetrated by white supremacist Dylann Roof, whose controversial website lastrhodesian.com contained pictures of him holding the Confederate Battle Flag, many flags were flown at half-staff, including those at the South Carolina State House. The Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina Confederate Monument[98] near the state house was not, as South Carolina law prohibits alteration of the flag without the consent of two-thirds of the state legislature.[99] The flagpole lacked a pulley system, and thus the flag could not be flown at half-staff, only removed.[99]\r\n\r\n\r\nFlags flying over Fort Sumter in 2009, including Confederate national flags\r\nIn June 2015, the National Park Service ceased flying Confederate flags over Fort Sumter.[100]\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 2015, three state governors—Terry McAuliffe of Virginia (a Democrat), Pat McCrory of North Carolina (a Republican), and Larry Hogan of Maryland (a Republican)—announced plans to seek discontinuation of their states' Confederate-flag specialty license plates. In addition to the Charleston killings, the governors cited the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, issued days earlier, in which the Court affirmed that states are not constitutionally obligated to issue Confederate specialty plates.[101]\r\n\r\nOn June 24, 2015, Robert Bentley, governor of Alabama, ordered the removal of the Confederate flag from a memorial on the state capitol grounds. A spokeswoman for Governor Robert Bentley told the Montgomery Advertiser on Wednesday that he did not want the flag to be a \"distraction\".[102] Speaking with AL.com, Bentley said he made the decision himself to take the flag down.[103]\r\n\r\nThere were renewed calls for the flag of Mississippi, the only state flag that still includes a Confederate battle emblem, to be changed, but several bills introduced in the Mississippi Legislature were not successful.[104] A number of municipalities and schools in Mississippi, including the University of Mississippi and the city of Biloxi, announced they would no longer display the current flag.[104][105]\r\n\r\nRemoval from South Carolina State Capitol\r\nFollowing the church shooting, many commentators questioned the continued display of the flag at the memorial on the State House grounds.[106][107][108][109][110] The flag had first been erected in 1962 by the state's Democratic governor in a protest against desegregation.[111] Opposition and attempts to remove the flag began almost immediately. In 1996, then-governor David Beasley pushed to have it removed from the Capitol dome, only to back off and then be driven from office two years later in the political blowback.[112]\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 2015, Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley called for the flag's removal from state house grounds.[113] In the following weeks before the flag was officially removed, several men and women, including activist Bree Newsome, were arrested for removing or attempting to remove the flag as well as various other offenses stemming from the protests around the flagpole. The attempts to remove the flag were criticized by several S.C. State legislators who supported the flag's removal because they said such actions could hurt their goal to have the flag permanently removed.[114][115][116][117][118]\r\n\r\nCalls to remove the Confederate flag from statehouse grounds, as well as debates over the context of its symbolic nature, were renewed after the attack[119][120] by several prominent figures, including President Barack Obama, Mitt Romney, and Jeb Bush.[121] On June 20, several thousand people gathered in front of the South Carolina State House in protest. An online petition at MoveOn.org encouraging the removal of the flag had received over 370,000 signatures by that time.[122]\r\n\r\nAt a statehouse press conference on June 22, 2015, Governor Nikki Haley, flanked by elected officials of both parties, including U.S. Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, and former Republican Governor Mark Sanford, called for the flag to be removed by the state legislature, saying that while the flag was \"an integral part of our past, it does not represent the future\" of South Carolina.[123] \"We are not going to allow this symbol to divide us any longer,\" she said. The legislature, scheduled to meet the following day for a budget session, must vote by a two-thirds majority to extend debate to the flag issue, and by two-thirds to remove the flag from statehouse grounds,[124] although the legality of that provision has been questioned by some lawmakers.[125] Haley said she would call for a special session if the legislature did not act.[123]\r\n\r\n\"With the winds that started blowing last week, I figured it would just be a matter of time,\" said Ken Thrasher, speaking for the South Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which opposes the flag's removal. \"Whatever the Legislature decides to do, we will accept it graciously.\"[125] A number of prominent Republicans who had previously appeared to struggle with the issue immediately endorsed Haley's call to remove the flag, including Kentucky Senator and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, and governors and presidential hopefuls Scott Walker and Rick Perry.[126]\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 2015, the South Carolina General Assembly added discussion of the flag to its special-session agenda in a procedural vote that indicated broad bipartisan support to remove the flag from the Statehouse grounds. The motion carried by a unanimous voice vote in the state senate and by a 103–10 vote in the state house. In the senate chamber, the desk of Clementa Pinckney, the pastor and state senator who died in the attack, was draped in black cloth with a white rose atop it. Among the legislators speaking in favor of removing the flag was Republican State Senator Paul Thurmond, son of Senator Strom Thurmond, whose 1948 \"Dixiecrat\" segregationist presidential campaign helped politically re-popularize the flag.[127][128]\r\n\r\nEulogizing the Rev. Clementa Pinckney on June 26, 2015, before 5,000 congregants at the College of Charleston, President Barack Obama acknowledged that the shooting had catalyzed a broad movement, backed by both Republicans and Democrats, to remove the flag from official public display. \"Blinded by hatred, [the gunman] failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood: the power of God's grace,\" Obama said. \"By taking down that flag we express God's grace. But I don't think God wants us to stop there.\"[129][130]\r\n\r\nOn July 6, 2015, the South Carolina Senate voted, by the required two-thirds majority, to remove the Confederate flag from display on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. Following 13 hours of debate and over 60 attempts to amend the bill, the vote in the South Carolina House of Representatives to remove the flag was passed by a two-thirds majority (94–20) on July 9. Governor Nikki Haley signed the bill the same day.[131] On July 10, the Confederate flag was taken down for the last time and it will be stored until it can be later shown at the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room & Military Museum.[132]\r\n\r\nFollowing the removal of the flag, the NAACP announced the end of its boycott of South Carolina.[93] This action marks the end of a fifteen year long boycott of the state. The initiation of the boycott began in 2000, when the Confederate Flag was moved from atop the State House to a Confederate memorial on the grounds of the Capitol. A motion to remove the boycott by the NAACP was called shortly after state legislation voted to remove the flag from the Capitol grounds. NAACP President Cornell William Brooks celebrated the state's decision, commenting that the action would make South Carolina more welcoming for all people regardless of their skin color.[133]\r\n\r\nRetailer bans\r\nFollowing the Charleston church shooting, the retailer Walmart announced that it would no longer sell items with the Confederate flag on them.[134] In a statement to the press, Walmart stated that \"We never want to offend anyone with the products that we offer. We have taken steps to remove all items promoting the Confederate flag from our assortment – whether in our stores or on our web site.\"[135][136]\r\n\r\nShortly afterward, a number of other retailers, including Amazon.com, eBay, Etsy, Sears (which also operates Kmart) and Target announced that they would also be removing Confederate flag items from sale.[137][138] Google also pulled Confederate flag merchandise from their shopping site.[139] Smaller flag retailers are also ceasing to sell it.[140]\r\n\r\nValley Forge Flag, Annin Flagmakers, Eder Flag and the Dixie Flag Manufacturing Company, four of the largest U.S. flag manufacturers, also announced that they would cease selling Confederate flags.[139][141][142][143]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"General Lee\", 1969 Dodge Charger, featured in The Dukes of Hazzard\r\nAfter Dylann Roof's racially motivated murder of nine people in a Charleston church, Warner Bros. announced that they were halting production of The Dukes of Hazzard \"General Lee\" toy cars, which prominently featured a Confederate flag on the roof of the car.[144] Reruns of The Dukes of Hazzard television show were also pulled from TV Land's schedule due to the controversy.[145] On July 2, 2015, professional golfer Bubba Watson announced that he would modify the General Lee car that he purchased at auction by painting an American flag over the Confederate flag that had appeared on the car's roof since it was customized for the TV series in 1978.[146][147] Actor Ben Jones, who portrayed Cooter in the original series, announced that his chain of Cooter's Place novelty stores would still sell merchandise featuring the flag.[148] Actor John Schneider, who portrayed Bo Duke in The Dukes of Hazzard television series, said he was \"saddened\" that Roof's murders could \"cause one of the most beloved television shows in the history of the medium to suddenly be seen in this light.\"[149]\r\n\r\nAlso in June 2015, Apple's App Store began removing mobile apps featuring the flag.[150] Several U.S Civil War-based wargames were initially removed, but Apple later announced that they were only targeting apps \"that use the Confederate flag in offensive or mean-spirited ways\" and was working with developers who felt that their apps were wrongly removed.[150][151]\r\n\r\nThe U.S. National Park Service announced that it is requesting that its retail partners stop selling the Confederate flag, as well as other items that depict the flag as a stand-alone feature.[152][153]\r\n\r\nNASCAR\r\nFollowing the Charleston church shooting, the American auto racing sanctioning body NASCAR, which has roots in the Southern United States and has many fans who fly the Confederate flag at campsites, supported Governor Haley in removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House. In addition, NASCAR chairman Brian France vowed the sanctioning body would not associate themselves with the flag and wanted to eliminate the flag from races. NASCAR Sprint Cup Series drivers and teammates Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Jeff Gordon, along with team owner and former NBA player Brad Daugherty (the only African-American team owner in NASCAR), also supported eliminating the Confederate flag from racing events.[154] Prior to the Coke Zero 400 race at Daytona International Speedway on July 5, 2015, the track announced fans can voluntarily exchange Confederate flags for American flags.[155] On July 2, 2015, the NASCAR tracks issued a joint statement calling for fans to refrain from flying the Confederate flag at races,[156] but many fans still continued the practice.[157]\r\n\r\nWashington National Cathedral\r\nAt the Washington National Cathedral, the Confederate battle flag appeared in two stained glass windows, which memorialize the Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. On June 8, 2016, Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington and the interim dean of the cathedral, said they would be removed \"as soon as we can do it,\" to be replaced, at least temporarily, by plain glass.[158]\r\n\r\nThe windows were installed in 1953 after lobbying from the Daughters of the Confederacy. The dean of the cathedral, the Very Rev. Gary Hall, stated that the Charleston church shooting was the catalyst for the planned removal, saying \"It seemed to me that we couldn't, with credibility, address the race agenda if we were going to keep the windows in there.\"[159][160] On September 6, 2017, workmen were removing them.[161]\r\n\r\nTrump rallies\r\nWithin a year of the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, a counter-backlash to the removal of Confederate flags that the shooting inspired is playing out across the country, according to Politico.[162] The counter-backlash has extended to the national political scene as well. In contrast to Trump’s 2015 remarks in favor of removing Confederate flags,[163] Trump has shifted rightward. Many of those in a coalition of racists, anti-government radicals, and states’ rights activists who have led the battle charge for restoration of the rebel flag believe the GOP presumptive nominee is offering dog-whistling encouragement.[162] A police officer, Michael Peters, resigned after being suspended for flying a Confederate flag from his pickup truck at a Nov. 11 \"Love Trumps Hate\" rally, three days after Trump’s presidential win.[164][165] Even though event organizers of rallies \"...asks participants only to bring American flags to the rally, with no Confederate flags allowed.\"[166], they continue to be seen at rallies.[167] On July 6, 2017, a Confederate battle flag was waved to greet President Trump upon his arrival in Poland for a brief visit before the G20 summit in Hamburg.[168]\r\n\r\nDisplay in South Carolina vandalized\r\nThree Sons of Confederate Veterans groups erected the flags of the United States, South Carolina, and the Confederacy June 16, 2018, on private land outside Holly Hill, South Carolina. A sign said the Sons of Confederate Veterans is honoring \"All of Our Ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nA newspaper report of June 21, 2018, said that graffiti that said \"Move\" and five dollar signs had been sprayed on the sign.\r\n\r\n\"Holly Hill Town Council asked the Confederate groups in April not to erect the display along U.S. 176. Mayor William Johnson said he was disappointed by the display.\"[169]\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nFlaggers (Confederate flag erectors)\r\nFlag of South Africa (1928–1994)\r\nList of Confederate monuments and memorials\r\nPost–World War II legality of Nazi flags\r\nThe Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag\r\nRemoval of Confederate monuments and memorials\r\nChristiansburg High School#Confederate Flag Protest\r\nFurther reading\r\nLadd, Donna (August 6, 2018). \"Pride and prejudice?

You do not know how to fuck wrong you are. Fidget spinners were designed for elite athletes, CEOs, and arch-bishops. Kids only adopted the spinning, we were born in it, molded by it. I've dedicated my life to fidget spinners. I'm the only truly certified grand master of fidget spinners; 3 time defending world champion WWE belt holder of fidget spinning. So I believe I'm the only one truly qualified to tell you that spinning is a man's sport, a man's man's sport. I was once a boy who became a man thanks to fidget spinning and also natural aging. Do you know the difference between me and a child? I'm 22 fucking years old, children are usually under 12 years old 68 miles per hour going straight into a brick wall of manliness. How do I stay in this physical form of this specimen that scientists can not even fully understand? Well it's going to make me happy again LeBron James shit his pants. I wake up at 4 am everyday, I drink 3 raw eggs with the side of pancakes with nails and a glass of straight uranium, then I grab my favorite fidget spinner: the triple XL gold-plated 25 pound weighted air- Supreme-extreme maximum turbo overdrive cutter spagooter with pump-action assault-grip and a silencer, i've even customized this bad boy with a laser dot sight printing capability as well as doubling as a fax machine. This is a gadget straight out of MI6, this is right brewed up from fucking Q laboratories- he used to make gadgets for 007 now he's making fidget spinners for me. Do you still think this is a fad for kids fucking troglodyte? Well I guess if that's how you wanna spin this story, but I know the truth, I know that this game was made for men and I've mastered it. I live and breathe fidget spinning. So go ahead, play your favorite sports and football baseball. I'll be here like a diss-jockey spinning it. Hugh! Sorry about that, it was not easy to be atssed at me, it was not easy being the great master of fidget spinning.","title":"Fidget spinners","postdate":"12:21 PM on 10/9/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"1769":{"poster":"savaka","content":"test","title":"please delete this post","postdate":"0:22 PM on 10/9/2018 EST","attachment":"none","deleted":true},"1770":{"poster":"herronjo","content":"Test","title":"Test","postdate":"12:28 PM on 10/9/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"1771":{"poster":"goddhoward666","content":"Buy Skyrim: Stibarc Edition or I will eat your fetus","title":"Skyrim: Stibarc Edition","postdate":"12:28 PM on 10/9/2018 EST","attachment":"1539102521808"},"1772":{"poster":"Mr.Shafer","content":"Cucks","title":"See attachment","postdate":"12:28 PM on 10/9/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"1773":{"poster":"goddhoward666","content":"I got the epic victory royal, take that L normies","title":"Take the L","postdate":"12:31 PM on 10/9/2018 EST","attachment":"1539102639493"},"1774":{"poster":"Aldeenyo","content":"I need the karma mom ","title":"Like for free v-buck","postdate":"12:31 PM on 10/9/2018 EST","attachment":"1539102705676"},"1775":{"poster":"Mr.Shafer","content":"I swear if this doesn't work","title":"See attachment 2","postdate":"12:31 PM on 10/9/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"1776":{"poster":"Mr.Shafer","content":"Last try","title":"Last try","postdate":"12:33 PM on 10/9/2018 EST","attachment":"1539102786893","deleted":true},"1777":{"poster":"goddhoward666","content":"┈┈┈┈╱▔╲▂▂╱▔╲┈┈┈┈ ┈┈┈▕╮╱▔╲╱▔╲╭▏┈┈┈ ┈┈┈╱╋▏┊▕┊┊▕╋╲┈┈┈ ┈┈▕╋▕━▅━━▅━▏╋▏┈┈ ┈┈▕╱▔╲▔╭╮▔╱▔╲▏┈┈ ┈┈▕┊┳┊▔╰╯▔┊┳┊▏┈┈ ┈┈┈╲╰━━╯╰━━╯╱┈┈┈ ┈┈┈╱▔╭┈┈┈┈╮▔╲┈┈┈ ┈┈╱▕┊┊┈Free ┊┊▏╲┈┈ ┈┈╲╱┊┊ Bobby ┊ ╱┈┈ ┈┈┈▏╋┊ Shmurda ▕┈┈┈ ┈┈┈╲╋╰┈┈┈┈╯╋╱┈┈┈ ╱▔╲┈╲╋╭▂▂╮╋╱┈┈┈┈ ▏╋▕▂╱▏┊▏▕┊▕┈┈┈┈┈ ╲▂▂▂╱▏┊▏▕┊▕┈┈┈┈┈ ┈┈╱▔▔┈╯╲╱╰┈▔▔╲┈┈ ┈┈╲▂▂▂▂╱╲▂▂▂▂","title":"Beef","postdate":"12:33 PM on 10/9/2018 EST","attachment":"none","deleted":true},"1778":{"poster":"Aldeenyo","content":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rlajoXSX5V9nwHpdQfd-78CW3xcEgzoS/view?usp=sharing","title":"Finna epic dub fortnite challenge","postdate":"12:35 PM on 10/9/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"1779":{"poster":"goddhoward666","content":"Wheres the lasagna","title":"John","postdate":"12:36 PM on 10/9/2018 EST","attachment":"1539103011516"},"1780":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"STiBaRC is supposed to have \"trash\" content however the content that has been appearing recently is exceeding the meter here.

Unfortunately, BaSTPC was developed when I barely learned HTML. The JavaScript for BaSTPC is actually from the actual STiBaRC repo files. BaSTPC also lacks  u s a g e . The majority of users use the main client, which is completely understandable. \r\n\r\nOn 01 January 2019, BaSTPC general support will end. A “short term” extended support period will begin the same day. During this period, only important and security updates will occur. After 31 March 2019, the short term extended support period will end. \r\n\r\nWhen the short term extended support period ends, the service will no longer receive any updates. You will also no longer be able to log in with your STiBaRC account, create posts, edit posts, vote on posts, edit profile settings, or comment on posts. Users will still be able to view posts and comments. \r\n\r\nThe BaSTPC app on Android OS and Fire Tablet devices will warn you to use the STiBaRC app shortly after the short term extended support period begins. After 31 April 2018, you will also no longer be able to log in with your STiBaRC account, create posts, edit posts, vote on posts, edit profile settings, or comment on posts. Users will still be able to view posts and comments. \r\n\r\nThe BaSTPC app will be removed from Google Play and Amazon shortly after.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to uninstall the BaSTPC app after 31 March. The app will warn users to use the main client. \r\n\r\nThank you to the few users who used BaSTPC! It is sad to see this go, but it is pointless to continue it.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to email me.","title":"Why BaSTPC is no longer being supported in January 2019","postdate":"2:48 AM on 12/23/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"2133":{"poster":"mooshoe","content":"heh ni","title":"stibarc suckz","postdate":"1:59 PM on 12/23/2018 EST","attachment":"none"},"2134":{"poster":"herronjo","content":"Have good Christmas Eve, if you celebrate it.

Easy summary: You can not die because as soon as you die that time line no longer exists for you. You continue life from the place of another version of yourself. This makes you essentially immortal, because even if you die you won't know it. You will continue on a different branch of reality where you survived. It is near impossible to prove for obvious reasons, but if it were true, do you think suicide would be an effective problem solver? Let's say your car breaks down. In the wise words of Frank King, \"I have three choices: Get it fixed, get a new one, or I could just kill myself. I know, doesn’t that sound absurd? But that thought actually pops into my head… It’s always on the menu.” Now let's say that you do choose suicide.

Roman Catholic sign of the cross is upside down, done with five fingers instead of three, is done from left to right instead of right to left, etc. (basically inviting demons). Antichrist's Third Temple will have 8 chambers: a chamber per main religion; antichrist will be crowned in this temple; during crowning, he won't read the \"belief prayer\" correctly (rejecting Christ and acknowledging himself); when he will take his gloves off to make sign of the cross incorrectly (just for show), many people will see his big nails and will reject him; Patriarch (who will be crowning him) will say that this is the antichrist; antichrist will kill him. Also, antichrist will kill those priests who disagree with him at the 8th \"wolf\" Council; others will worship him when a bird dies at his feet. Roman Catholics, Satanists, and Buddhists use the same mudras; if you see these mudras on an icon, then it's not Orthodox icon; Orthodox icon has IC XC symbol (Jesus Christ). Roman Catholics pay drunks and prostitutes to pose for icons; passions of drunks and prostitutes transfer to those who pray to these images. Normal Orthodox icons are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Gaad in Ruski = Satan; hence, Americans = blasphemers because they always say: \"Oh, my god!\". Santa (word for Saint in Satanic languages) = Satan; hence, Spanish + Italian + Portuguese = blasphemers. Anathema to Satanic languages; triple anathema. Learn Church Slavonic; no curses in it; curses = prayer to Satan. All religions except Orthodoxy worship Satan. On bread for communion: IC XC NIKA (Jesus Christ Conquers) plus cross = Orthodox; hexagram plus Dusha Maya = antichrist. Jews and Muslims pray head down (either standing, bowing, or kneeling); this is Satanic prayer. Orthodox look into the eyes of icon; energy goes their way; they get healed; head and shoulders come together to reject Satan slowly and then fast to normal showing allegiance to Christ and not the devil. Hands cannot be on groin or behind back; either put them crossing each other on chest (right over left) or just by your sides. Legs together so that a demon doesn't run underneath your legs. Clergy who will not \"put Buddhist icons and serve antichrist's blood\" will be killed; only 7 churches will be left as Pelageya of Ryazan predicted. In 2006 and at other meetings, fake patriarchs and bishops signed a bunch of documents betraying Orthodoxy by saying that all religions worship the same Supreme Being; triple anathema; don't let heretics tell you what to do. America will be last country to switch to Euro. Three big earthquakes will shake the three superpowers; 1st big earthquake in Russia; 2nd (bigger one) in China; 3rd (biggest of the three) will be in America. NATO will nuke Ukraine to blame Russia for it; then NATO will nuke Russia from Scandinavia. China will attack Russia; but will not get past Ural Mountains; bio-genetic weapon will be used against Chinese soldiers (they will run back to China and hide in closets in fear) and weather weapon will freeze Siberia to – 200 Celcius; stadium-size chunks of unmeltable ice will fall from the lower sky (because when rockets go into higher sky they bring this ice down to lower sky). Russia will destroy Turkey and America. China will have a hole across the whole country to the abyss (because of another super weapon used to stop Chinese aggression); radiation from this hole will be massive; Chinese will try to keep quiet about it; a lot of people will fall into this hole. \r\nScientists don't see dinosaurs because of radiation. Only Eurasia and Alaska (both without coasts) will remain after demons blow up Antarctica (which surrounds the flat earth) and Greenland melts. Move to Ural Mountains or inland Alaska. Sionists wanted war between Russia and Germany from June 11th to October 11th on their holidays because (666 times 3)+(6 times 3) = 2016 (in their twisted logic). \r\nTube people = demons. Clones = demons. Human costumes that demons wear = demons. Dinosaurs and 666ed people have triple stranded DNA; normal person can't swallow 666ed food (designed for 666ed people). Demons live inside clones. Bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin (who discovered Bubonic plague) is depicted on the Shroud of Turin. There is another shroud (Shroud of Milan) on which blasphemer Yosef (who was crucified on a pole in 1066 AD) is depicted. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Lenin (el=deity in Hebrew, nine = no in German; so, when chanted repeatedly is blasphemy against the Creator), and Yosef were possessed by Azazel; now, Rico Cortes is possessed by Azazel. \r\nWW3 happens; 7% of people will be left; after people are tired of war, they will elect the antichrist as one world leader; don't vote. ISIS stands for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service. Next false flag: Statue of Liberty in order to attack Iran; one big shake, one giant step forward, one giant collapse. Move away from coasts as nukes will go off in the ocean (at where tectonic plates meet; result: megatsunamis 1km high). \r\nWear natural clothing so that if a bomb goes off it won't stick to the body as fast as synthetic clothes. All metal will be burned for fuel; so, save knives, crowbars, shovels, wood-burning stoves, etc. Also, save cloth/fabric/textile to cover the wounds and diseases. \r\nEat natural food because nanochips, cells of aborted fetuses, bug DNA, and other poisons are in food that is commonly sold; reject vaccines, medical care, medicine, etc. because nanochips are administered thru IVs, implants, fillings, etc. If 1000-1500 nanochips are in your right hand, then you can't make proper Orthodox sign of the cross with the right hand; last mercy for you then will be to cut the hand off. \r\nSeraphim of Sarov and Sergiy of Radonezh will be resurrected after WW3 for a short time; Seraphim of Sarov will show the new Ruski Tsar who will fight the antichrist for about 2 years and 8 months. Those who go see Seraphim of Sarov will be healed of their infirmities/illnesses/sicknesses/ diseases; if you want to see him then, hurry because he won't stay longer than a few weeks. \r\nEarth is flat; stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. \r\nHumans were created about 7525 years ago. Ruski Orthodox Christian Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Enoch and Elijah return to preach against the antichrist. \r\nBirds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level. They will get out through sinkholes and lakes. To kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. \r\nDemons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be healed inside their UFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer.\r\n\r\nDon't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)Moon 2)Inside fake mountain Kailash in Tibet 3)In lake Baikal in Russia 4)In Atlantis which is underneath the Mariana Trench in Pacific Ocean. There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. \r\nAirplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old. He flies very fast; deceived people will say that \"Christ is here; Christ is there\". Sometimes, he wears blue robe over left shoulder while red robe is underneath. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He's surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people to believe that he can do mountain moving and resurrection (using holograms); fire from the sky is easy (considering the gases from pollution in the atmosphere). \r\nDon't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Green 666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (World Passport). Police will microchip and isotope ray people on the highways. Microchipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, 666 is given. Food stores will isotope ray people too. Antichrist will also release prisoners to mark people. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. \r\nIf you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with Orthodox Christians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can't track you. Burn documents because they're from Satan. Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael; he rescues people from temporary hell twice a year (or brings them up a level, that is, to a level with less punishment; eventually, people are freed). Feed the pigeons; when pigeons bow down, people are saved from temporary hell.","title":"how strong is your good","postdate":"12:33 PM on 2/5/2019 EST","attachment":"none"},"2278":{"poster":"alexjones.infowars","content":"this pussy designer, call it cucci","title":"Important news","postdate":"12:34 PM on 2/5/2019 EST","attachment":"none","deleted":true},"2279":{"poster":"Ogelbeh","content":"Theyre clingy af.

I didn't ask any questions even tho it was weird. I don't have anything to hide, so I didn't want to seem suspicious and I thought this was like a spot check of some kind.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of minutes, she takes the time to come back and ask me for my phone and that I would \"kindly give the passcode for it.\" Now I was asking why, she said, \"I'm just following orders.\" I know the principal ain't want my stuff. The principal doesn't really get involved with anything of the sort, so I know she knew why she wanted my stuff. I didn't have my phone on me as, during one of my classes before, the teacher makes you put it in a tray thing. So I told her EXACTLY where it was.\r\n\r\nA little while into my next class the teacher got a call from her asking for me to come down. I went into her office and there she was, just sitting in her chair with a sly ass smile. On her desk was my macbook, my bro's macbook, and his phone. She said, \"you can have your mac back, but we had to change your password to school123\" (the default password). WTF, I GAVE MY MAC TO YOU WITH IT UNLOCKED, WHY? There was no explanation to why she had done any of this except that she said she was \"keeping me safe.\" BOI, I THINK LETTING ME KNOW OF DANGER WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER IDEA THAN NOT SAYING ANYTHING, but, whatever. At least I have my stuff back...\r\nTurns out that she never went and got my real phone from where I said it was. IT WAS STILL THEIR. BOI, IF YOU NEEDED MY PHONE, AND DIDN'T GO GET IT WHERE IT WAS, THEN WHAT'S YOUR DEAL? (i didn't say that) So whatever it is/was it must not be important enough for you to go and get it.\r\n\r\nI got back to class and open my mac. Yup, my password was changed to the insecure ass password of \"school123\". After logging in I come to find a crap ton of windows open such as my email, finder window with folders open, my, now logged out chrome instance, and the activity monitor (tho it might have been open before). So after finding my chrome logged out, I go to log it back in. I typed in the password and what do you know, THE PASSWORD FOR MY PERSONAL EMAIL IS ALSO CHANGED. But not even to school123. idk what it was changed to, so I changed it back with my phone.\r\nThe finder window open was of a folder named \"Crap\" that was on my desktop. That is where I keep a bunch of crap such as screenshots and small files I rarely use but don't feel the need to remove.\r\n\r\nWhat's more is that this was ONLY done with me, my bro, and maybe someone else. All at the same time. Idk who the other person was and don't know if it was even related to this.\r\nI still haven't figured out what they were looking for and why, but let me tell you, THIS WAS UNCALLED FOR. Not only did she want my mac, but she also wanted my personal phone AND THE PASSCODE FOR IT. All without any explanation to me OR my parents. Yes, they won't even say anything to my parents. Wtf.\r\nMy parent is going to ask why tf they can't give an answer to anyone. Whatever they say, I bet it won't be anywhere near a good explanation to all the crap they tried pulling.\r\n\r\nThis is what folder they had open (it was fullscreen as well)","title":"Vice principal had orders to \"take my macbook and phone.\" (wanting the passcode)","postdate":"4:43 PM on 2/11/2019 EST","attachment":"1549921394430"},"2313":{"poster":"Ogelbeh","content":"Delicatessen meats.

Where is the Opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?\r\n\r\nTwo things result from this fact.\r\n\r\nI. Communism is already acknowledged by all European Powers to be itself a Power.\r\n\r\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\r\n\r\nTo this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London, and sketched the following Manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.\r\n\r\nI. BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS\r\nThe history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles.\r\n\r\nFreeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.\r\n\r\nThe modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\r\n\r\nFrom the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.\r\n\r\nThe feudal system of industry, under which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class; division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop.\r\n\r\nMeantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacture no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry, the place of the industrial middle class, by industrial millionaires, the leaders of whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.\r\n\r\nModern industry has established the world-market, for which the discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This development has, in its time, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.\r\n\r\nEach step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing association in the mediaeval commune; here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany), there taxable \"third estate\" of the monarchy (as in France), afterwards, in the period of manufacture proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, corner-stone of the great monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world-market, conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway. The executive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his \"natural superiors,\" and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous \"cash payment.\" It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless and indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom—Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which Reactionists so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man's activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.\r\n\r\nThe need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood. All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the productions of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world literature.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation. The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has agglomerated production, and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation. Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws, governments and systems of taxation, became lumped together into one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national class-interest, one frontier and one customs-tariff. The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature's forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground—what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?\r\n\r\nWe see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.\r\n\r\nInto their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted to it, and by the economical and political sway of the bourgeois class.\r\n\r\nA similar movement is going on before our own eyes. Modern bourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. For many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production, against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule. It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put on its trial, each time more threateningly, the existence of the entire bourgeois society. In these crises a great part not only of the existing products, but also of the previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed. In these crises there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity—the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property. The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them. And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand inforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.\r\n\r\nThe weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.\r\n\r\nBut not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons—the modern working class—the proletarians.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working class, developed—a class of labourers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital. These labourers, who must sell themselves piece-meal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.\r\n\r\nOwing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working hours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of the machinery, etc.\r\n\r\nModern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is.\r\n\r\nThe less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class. All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.\r\n\r\nNo sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, so far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.\r\n\r\nThe lower strata of the middle class—the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants—all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialized skill is rendered worthless by the new methods of production. Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population.\r\n\r\nThe proletariat goes through various stages of development. With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At first the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by the workpeople of a factory, then by the operatives of one trade, in one locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them. They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments of production themselves; they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual competition. If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies, this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its own political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so. At this stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their enemies, the remnants of absolute monarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the petty bourgeoisie. Thus the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nBut with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses, its strength grows, and it feels that strength more. The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level. The growing competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating. The unceasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes. Thereupon the workers begin to form combinations (Trades Unions) against the bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages; they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts. Here and there the contest breaks out into riots.\r\n\r\nNow and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever-expanding union of the workers. This union is helped on by the improved means of communication that are created by modern industry and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle between classes. But every class struggle is a political struggle. And that union, to attain which the burghers of the Middle Ages, with their miserable highways, required centuries, the modern proletarians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few years.\r\n\r\nThis organisation of the proletarians into a class, and consequently into a political party, is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves. But it ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers, by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself. Thus the ten-hours' bill in England was carried.\r\n\r\nAltogether collisions between the classes of the old society further, in many ways, the course of development of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle. At first with the aristocracy; later on, with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry; at all times, with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries. In all these battles it sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for its help, and thus, to drag it into the political arena. The bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its own instruments of political and general education, in other words, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nFurther, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling classes are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence. These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress.\r\n\r\nFinally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the process of dissolution going on within the ruling class, in fact within the whole range of society, assumes such a violent, glaring character, that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands. Just as, therefore, at an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole.\r\n\r\nOf all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product. The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by chance they are revolutionary, they are so only in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat, they thus defend not their present, but their future interests, they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat.\r\n\r\nThe \"dangerous class,\" the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of old society, may, here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.\r\n\r\nIn the conditions of the proletariat, those of old society at large are already virtually swamped. The proletarian is without property; his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois family-relations; modern industrial labour, modern subjection to capital, the same in England as in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped him of every trace of national character. Law, morality, religion, are to him so many bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests.\r\n\r\nAll the preceding classes that got the upper hand, sought to fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation. The proletarians cannot become masters of the productive forces of society, except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation. They have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property.\r\n\r\nAll previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interests of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interests of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air.\r\n\r\nThough not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nIn depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.\r\n\r\nHitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes. But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its slavish existence. The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty bourgeois, under the yoke of feudal absolutism, managed to develop into a bourgeois. The modern laborer, on the contrary, instead of rising with the progress of industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class. He becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth. And here it becomes evident, that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law. It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other words, its existence is no longer compatible with society.\r\n\r\nThe essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of the bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of capital; the condition for capital is wage-labour. Wage-labour rests exclusively on competition between the laborers. The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition, by their revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, is its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.\r\n\r\nII. PROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS\r\nIn what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?\r\n\r\nThe Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other working-class parties.\r\n\r\nThey have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.\r\n\r\nThey do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.\r\n\r\nThe Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: (1) In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality. (2) In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.\r\n\r\nThe immediate aim of the Communist is the same as that of all the other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer. They merely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our very eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of Communism.\r\n\r\nAll property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.\r\n\r\nWe Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man's own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence.\r\n\r\nHard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of the petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.\r\n\r\nOr do you mean modern bourgeois private property?\r\n\r\nBut does wage-labour create any property for the labourer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage-labour. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.\r\n\r\nTo be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social status in production. Capital is a collective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.\r\n\r\nCapital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all members of society, personal property is not thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social character of the property that is changed. It loses its class-character.\r\n\r\nLet us now take wage-labour.\r\n\r\nThe average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of the means of subsistence, which is absolutely requisite in bare existence as a labourer. What, therefore, the wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence. We by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labour, an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of others. All that we want to do away with, is the miserable character of this appropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it.\r\n\r\nIn bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase accumulated labour. In Communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.\r\n\r\nIn bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in Communist society, the present dominates the past. In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.\r\n\r\nAnd the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.\r\n\r\nBy freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free selling and buying.\r\n\r\nBut if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also. This talk about free selling and buying, and all the other \"brave words\" of our bourgeoisie about freedom in general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted selling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages, but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production, and of the bourgeoisie itself.\r\n\r\nYou are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.\r\n\r\nIn one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so; that is just what we intend.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital, money, or rent, into a social power capable of being monopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital, from that moment, you say individuality vanishes.\r\n\r\nYou must, therefore, confess that by \"individual\" you mean no other person than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of property. This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and made impossible.\r\n\r\nCommunism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriation.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected that upon the abolition of private property all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.\r\n\r\nAccording to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything, do not work. The whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology: that there can no longer be any wage-labour when there is no longer any capital.\r\n\r\nAll objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating material products, have, in the same way, been urged against the Communistic modes of producing and appropriating intellectual products. Just as, to the bourgeois, the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture.\r\n\r\nThat culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority, a mere training to act as a machine.\r\n\r\nBut don't wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended abolition of bourgeois property, the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom, culture, law, etc. Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all, a will, whose essential character and direction are determined by the economical conditions of existence of your class.\r\n\r\nThe selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property—historical relations that rise and disappear in the progress of production—this misconception you share with every ruling class that has preceded you. What you see clearly in the case of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal property, you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois form of property.\r\n\r\nAbolition of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists.\r\n\r\nOn what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On capital, on private gain. In its completely developed form this family exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.\r\n\r\nDo you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents? To this crime we plead guilty.\r\n\r\nBut, you will say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace home education by social.\r\n\r\nAnd your education! Is not that also social, and determined by the social conditions under which you educate, by the intervention, direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools, etc.? The Communists have not invented the intervention of society in education; they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about the hallowed co-relation of parent and child, becomes all the more disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour.\r\n\r\nBut you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the whole bourgeoisie in chorus.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women.\r\n\r\nHe has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have no need to introduce community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nOur bourgeois, not content with having the wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives.\r\n\r\nBourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with, is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised community of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.\r\n\r\nThe Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality.\r\n\r\nThe working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is, so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word.\r\n\r\nNational differences and antagonisms between peoples are daily more and more vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world-market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto.\r\n\r\nThe supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the leading civilised countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.\r\n\r\nThe charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical, and, generally, from an ideological standpoint, are not deserving of serious examination.\r\n\r\nDoes it require deep intuition to comprehend that man's ideas, views and conceptions, in one word, man's consciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his social life?\r\n\r\nWhat else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.\r\n\r\nWhen people speak of ideas that revolutionise society, they do but express the fact, that within the old society, the elements of a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.\r\n\r\nWhen the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient religions were overcome by Christianity. When Christian ideas succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" it will be said, \"religious, moral, philosophical and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical development. But religion, morality philosophy, political science, and law, constantly survived this change.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc. that are common to all states of society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs.\r\n\r\nBut whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past ages, viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the other. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past ages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays, moves within certain common forms, or general ideas, which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of class antagonisms.\r\n\r\nThe Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.\r\n\r\nBut let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.\r\n\r\nWe have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the working class, is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling as to win the battle of democracy.\r\n\r\nThe proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nOf course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.\r\n\r\nThese measures will of course be different in different countries.\r\n\r\nNevertheless in the most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.\r\n\r\n1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.\r\n\r\n2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.\r\n\r\n3. Abolition of all right of inheritance.\r\n\r\n4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.\r\n\r\n5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.\r\n\r\n6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.\r\n\r\n7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.\r\n\r\n8. Equal liability of all to labour. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.\r\n\r\n9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country, by a more equable distribution of the population over the country.\r\n\r\n10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.\r\n\r\nIn place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\r\n\r\nIII. SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE\r\n1. REACTIONARY SOCIALISM\r\nA. Feudal Socialism\r\n\r\nOwing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the aristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against modern bourgeois society. In the French revolution of July 1830, and in the English reform agitation, these aristocracies again succumbed to the hateful upstart. Thenceforth, a serious political contest was altogether out of the question. A literary battle alone remained possible. But even in the domain of literature the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible.\r\n\r\nIn order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy were obliged to lose sight, apparently, of their own interests, and to formulate their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone. Thus the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on their new master, and whispering in his ears sinister prophecies of coming catastrophe.\r\n\r\nIn this way arose Feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half lampoon; half echo of the past, half menace of the future; at times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the bourgeoisie to the very heart's core; but always ludicrous in its effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of modern history.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner. But the people, so often as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter.\r\n\r\nOne section of the French Legitimists and \"Young England\" exhibited this spectacle.\r\n\r\nIn pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to that of the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite different, and that are now antiquated. In showing that, under their rule, the modern proletariat never existed, they forget that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their own form of society.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary character of their criticism that their chief accusation against the bourgeoisie amounts to this, that under the bourgeois regime a class is being developed, which is destined to cut up root and branch the old order of society.\r\n\r\nWhat they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates a proletariat, as that it creates a revolutionary proletariat.\r\n\r\nIn political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive measures against the working class; and in ordinary life, despite their high falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the golden apples dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter truth, love, and honour for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and potato spirits.\r\n\r\nAs the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord, so has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism.\r\n\r\nNothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the place of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian Socialism is but the holy, water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.\r\n\r\nB. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism\r\n\r\nThe feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by the bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions of existence pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society. The mediaeval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie. In those countries which are but little developed, industrially and commercially, these two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nIn countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed, fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever renewing itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society. The individual members of this class, however, are being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition, and, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent section of modern society, to be replaced, in manufactures, agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen.\r\n\r\nIn countries like France, where the peasants constitute far more than half of the population, it was natural that writers who sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, should use, in their criticism of the bourgeois regime, the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois, and from the standpoint of these intermediate classes should take up the cudgels for the working class. Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism. Sismondi was the head of this school, not only in France but also in England.\r\n\r\nThis school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions in the conditions of modern production. It laid bare the hypocritical apologies of economists. It proved, incontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and division of labour; the concentration of capital and land in a few hands; overproduction and crises; it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery of the proletariat, the anarchy in production, the crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial war of extermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral bonds, of the old family relations, of the old nationalities.\r\n\r\nIn its positive aims, however, this form of Socialism aspires either to restoring the old means of production and of exchange, and with them the old property relations, and the old society, or to cramping the modern means of production and of exchange, within the framework of the old property relations that have been, and were bound to be, exploded by those means. In either case, it is both reactionary and Utopian.\r\n\r\nIts last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture, patriarchal relations in agriculture.\r\n\r\nUltimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating effects of self-deception, this form of Socialism ended in a miserable fit of the blues.\r\n\r\nC. German, or \"True,\" Socialism\r\n\r\nThe Socialist and Communist literature of France, a literature that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power, and that was the expression of the struggle against this power, was introduced into Germany at a time when the bourgeoisie, in that country, had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism.\r\n\r\nGerman philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux esprits, eagerly seized on this literature, only forgetting, that when these writings immigrated from France into Germany, French social conditions had not immigrated along with them. In contact with German social conditions, this French literature lost all its immediate practical significance, and assumed a purely literary aspect. Thus, to the German philosophers of the eighteenth century, the demands of the first French Revolution were nothing more than the demands of \"Practical Reason\" in general, and the utterance of the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie signified in their eyes the law of pure Will, of Will as it was bound to be, of true human Will generally.\r\n\r\nThe world of the German literate consisted solely in bringing the new French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical conscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without deserting their own philosophic point of view.\r\n\r\nThis annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign language is appropriated, namely, by translation.\r\n\r\nIt is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic Saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient heathendom had been written. The German literate reversed this process with the profane French literature. They wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original. For instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic functions of money, they wrote \"Alienation of Humanity,\" and beneath the French criticism of the bourgeois State they wrote \"dethronement of the Category of the General,\" and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of\r\nthe French historical criticisms they dubbed \"Philosophy of\r\nAction,\" \"True Socialism,\" \"German Science of Socialism,\"\r\n\"Philosophical Foundation of Socialism,\" and so on.\r\nThe French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely emasculated. And, since it ceased in the hands of the German to express the struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having overcome \"French one-sidedness\" and of representing, not true requirements, but the requirements of truth; not the interests of the proletariat, but the interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who belongs to no class, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm of philosophical fantasy.\r\n\r\nThis German Socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously and solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such mountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence.\r\n\r\nThe fight of the German, and especially, of the Prussian bourgeoisie, against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, in other words, the liberal movement, became more earnest.\r\n\r\nBy this, the long wished-for opportunity was offered to \"True\" Socialism of confronting the political movement with the Socialist demands, of hurling the traditional anathemas against liberalism, against representative government, against bourgeois competition, bourgeois freedom of the press, bourgeois legislation, bourgeois liberty and equality, and of preaching to the masses that they had nothing to gain, and everything to lose, by this bourgeois movement. German Socialism forgot, in the nick of time, that the French criticism, whose silly echo it was, presupposed the existence of modern bourgeois society, with its corresponding economic conditions of existence, and the political constitution adapted thereto, the very things whose attainment was the object of the pending struggle in Germany.\r\n\r\nTo the absolute governments, with their following of parsons, professors, country squires and officials, it served as a welcome scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nIt was a sweet finish after the bitter pills of floggings and bullets with which these same governments, just at that time, dosed the German working-class risings.\r\n\r\nWhile this \"True\" Socialism thus served the governments as a weapon for fighting the German bourgeoisie, it, at the same time, directly represented a reactionary interest, the interest of the German Philistines. In Germany the petty-bourgeois class, a relic of the sixteenth century, and since then constantly cropping up again under various forms, is the real social basis of the existing state of things.\r\n\r\nTo preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in Germany. The industrial and political supremacy of the bourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction; on the one hand, from the concentration of capital; on the other, from the rise of a revolutionary proletariat. \"True\" Socialism appeared to kill these two birds with one stone. It spread like an epidemic.\r\n\r\nThe robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers of rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this transcendental robe in which the German Socialists wrapped their sorry \"eternal truths,\" all skin and bone, served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods amongst such a public. And on its part, German Socialism recognised, more and more, its own calling as the bombastic representative of the petty-bourgeois Philistine.\r\n\r\nIt proclaimed the German nation to be the model nation, and the German petty Philistine to be the typical man. To every villainous meanness of this model man it gave a hidden, higher, Socialistic interpretation, the exact contrary of its real character. It went to the extreme length of directly opposing the \"brutally destructive\" tendency of Communism, and of proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class struggles. With very few exceptions, all the so-called Socialist and Communist publications that now (1847) circulate in Germany belong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature.\r\n\r\n2. CONSERVATIVE, OR BOURGEOIS, SOCIALISM\r\nA part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances, in order to secure the continued existence of bourgeois society.\r\n\r\nTo this section belong economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, improvers of the condition of the working class, organisers of charity, members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, temperance fanatics, hole-and-corner reformers of every imaginable kind. This form of Socialism has, moreover, been worked out into complete systems.\r\n\r\nWe may cite Proudhon's Philosophie de la Misere as an example of this form.\r\n\r\nThe Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom. They desire the existing state of society minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements. They wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat. The bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best; and bourgeois Socialism develops this comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems. In requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system, and thereby to march straightway into the social New Jerusalem, it but requires in reality, that the proletariat should remain within the bounds of existing society, but should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nA second and more practical, but less systematic, form of this Socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working class, by showing that no mere political reform, but only a change in the material conditions of existence, in economic relations, could be of any advantage to them. By changes in the material conditions of existence, this form of Socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of the bourgeois relations of production, an abolition that can be effected only by a revolution, but administrative reforms, based on the continued existence of these relations; reforms, therefore, that in no respect affect the relations between capital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and simplify the administrative work, of bourgeois government.\r\n\r\nBourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression, when, and only when, it becomes a mere figure of speech.\r\n\r\nFree trade: for the benefit of the working class. Protective duties: for the benefit of the working class. Prison Reform: for the benefit of the working class. This is the last word and the only seriously meant word of bourgeois Socialism.\r\n\r\nIt is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois—for the benefit of the working class.\r\n\r\n3. CRITICAL-UTOPIAN SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM\r\nWe do not here refer to that literature which, in every great modern revolution, has always given voice to the demands of the proletariat, such as the writings of Babeuf and others.\r\n\r\nThe first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends, made in times of universal excitement, when feudal society was being overthrown, these attempts necessarily failed, owing to the then undeveloped state of the proletariat, as well as to the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation, conditions that had yet to be produced, and could be produced by the impending bourgeois epoch alone. The revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character. It inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist and Communist systems properly so called, those of Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen and others, spring into existence in the early undeveloped period, described above, of the struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie (see Section 1. Bourgeois and Proletarians).\r\n\r\nThe founders of these systems see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as well as the action of the decomposing elements, in the prevailing form of society. But the proletariat, as yet in its infancy, offers to them the spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any independent political movement.\r\n\r\nSince the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the development of industry, the economic situation, as they find it, does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat. They therefore search after a new social science, after new social laws, that are to create these conditions.\r\n\r\nHistorical action is to yield to their personal inventive action, historically created conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones, and the gradual, spontaneous class-organisation of the proletariat to the organisation of society specially contrived by these inventors. Future history resolves itself, in their eyes, into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of their social plans.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of their plans they are conscious of caring chiefly for the interests of the working class, as being the most suffering class. Only from the point of view of being the most suffering class does the proletariat exist for them.\r\n\r\nThe undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms. They want to improve the condition of every member of society, even that of the most favoured. Hence, they habitually appeal to society at large, without distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the ruling class. For how can people, when once they understand their system, fail to see in it the best possible plan of the best possible state of society?\r\n\r\nHence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary, action; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means, and endeavour, by small experiments, necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way for the new social Gospel.\r\n\r\nSuch fantastic pictures of future society, painted at a time when the proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has but a fantastic conception of its own position correspond with the first instinctive yearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of society.\r\n\r\nBut these Socialist and Communist publications contain also a critical element. They attack every principle of existing society. Hence they are full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working class. The practical measures proposed in them—such as the abolition of the distinction between town and country, of the family, of the carrying on of industries for the account of private individuals, and of the wage system, the proclamation of social harmony, the conversion of the functions of the State into a mere superintendence of production, all these proposals, point solely to the disappearance of class antagonisms which were, at that time, only just cropping up, and which, in these publications, are recognised in their earliest, indistinct and undefined forms only. These proposals, therefore, are of a purely Utopian character.\r\n\r\nThe significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism bears an inverse relation to historical development. In proportion as the modern class struggle develops and takes definite shape, this fantastic standing apart from the contest, these fantastic attacks on it, lose all practical value and all theoretical justification. Therefore, although the originators of these systems were, in many respects, revolutionary, their disciples have, in every case, formed mere reactionary sects. They hold fast by the original views of their masters, in opposition to the progressive historical development of the proletariat. They, therefore, endeavour, and that consistently, to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms. They still dream of experimental realisation of their social Utopias, of founding isolated \"phalansteres,\" of establishing \"Home Colonies,\" of setting up a \"Little Icaria\"—duodecimo editions of the New Jerusalem—and to realise all these castles in the air, they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois. By degrees they sink into the category of the reactionary conservative Socialists depicted above, differing from these only by more systematic pedantry, and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous effects of their social science.\r\n\r\nThey, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the part of the working class; such action, according to them, can only result from blind unbelief in the new Gospel.\r\n\r\nThe Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France, respectively, oppose the Chartists and the Reformistes.\r\n\r\nIV. POSITION OF THE COMMUNISTS IN RELATION TO THE VARIOUS EXISTING OPPOSITION PARTIES\r\nSection II has made clear the relations of the Communists to the existing working-class parties, such as the Chartists in England and the Agrarian Reformers in America.\r\nThe Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future of that movement. In France the Communists ally themselves with the Social-Democrats, against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the right to take up a critical position in regard to phrases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland they support the Radicals, without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeois.\r\n\r\nIn Poland they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation, that party which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846.\r\n\r\nIn Germany they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the absolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nBut they never cease, for a single instant, to instil into the working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the German workers may straightaway use, as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the social and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy, and in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in Germany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin.\r\n\r\nThe Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of European civilisation, and with a much more developed proletariat, than that of England was in the seventeenth, and of France in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.\r\n\r\nIn all these movements they bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property question, no matter what its degree of development at the time.\r\n\r\nFinally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries.\r\n\r\nThe Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims.\r\nThey openly declare that their ends can be attained only by\r\nthe forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.\r\nLet the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution.\r\nThe proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.\r\nThey have a world to win.\r\nWORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 61.txt or 61.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in: http://www.gutenberg.net/6/61/\r\n\r\nTranscribed by Allen Lutins with assistance from Jim Tarzia.\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.","title":"Epic fortnite gameplay","postdate":"12:40 PM on 3/11/2019 EST","attachment":"1552322230257"},"2466":{"poster":"ModernFeelGames","content":"Mobile Task Force unit Epsilon - 11, Designated “Nine Tailed Fox” has entered the facility.

He did a fair amount of trade considering its location and would always welcome the strangest of creatures and humans alike. Especially when a human named Frisk spare them all and became friends, it was like the monsters came to the bar as a relief for having a second chance on life, though most of the monsters would die for their king, even if he was an idiot. Yes, business was booming, now that the barrier was open and humans and monsters got on like a house on fire…though Grillby the bar owner really hated that expression…it was a human thing, he guessed. Grillby got along with everyone, though he didn't talk much…but…there was one monster he was suspicious over, a monster who almost got away with a bad ending…this very monster was sitting at the bar…alone.\r\n\r\nA flower.\r\n\r\nAn anthropomorphic flower.\r\n\r\nGrillby heard rumours about a flower recently causing havoc on the world and trying to twist the truth on some people and even persuading monsters or humans to do evil things…evil things that would result in death or murder\r\n\r\nGrillby had serve this flower anyway…but he knew straight away who it was, it only accured to him why he actually served this…flower anyway, maybe because Grillby liked to treat everyone as equals but as the minutes went by, he started to feel uncomfortable. He hadn't chucked anyone from his bar for a long time and it looked like that trend was about to be broken. He watched as the flower just stared at its drink with a frustrated look on it…it's fingers gently rubbing the rim of the shot glass. Grillby looked at the odd creature and what it was wearing.\r\n\r\nAn almost pale, almost flat face with no nose but eyes dark with menace, beautiful massive yellow petals around its head. It was wearing a green and white corset type top, with fish net sleeves around its green arms, a black heart bow tie, and wavy long leaves covering it's yellowish legs and long brown boots. It was a beauty to look at and very feminine, at least that's what Grillby thought, he honestly thought this flower was female…then again, Grillby was awful at gender guessing, unless it was blatantly obvious, he wasn't that daft.\r\n\r\nThe other members in the bar were looking at the flower to, whispering and talking behind it's back, feeling uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nWords and whispers were spreading throughout the bar.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, isn't that…?\"\r\n\r\n\"Asriel? The son of Asgore…?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's dead, isn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's he doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"What form has he taken?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't want him here…?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not after what he tried to do!\"\r\n\r\nIt got to the point where the guest were purposely talking louder so the flower could hear.\r\n\r\n\"He's name's Flowey, Flowey the Flower…he's a menace!\"\r\n\r\nFlowey sighed and bit his lip, he could feel the anger starting to boil inside him, he tried his best to ignore the other guests but it wasn't easy.\r\n\r\n\"Get rid of him, Grillby! He's not wanted here!\" said one of the monsters. \"He shouldn't have been spared!\"\r\n\r\nFlowey closed his eyes and frowned, he gripped his glass tightly before taking a sip. Grillby didn't like to see his punters upset, even if the flower was just sitting on his own doing nothing, he didn't like the tension being caused. Grillby finished cleaning the glass he had been cleaning for an hour and hesitantly walked over to the flower. Flowey acknowledged this and just rolled his eyes.\r\n\r\nGRILLBY: Look…I think you should leave.\r\n\r\nFLOWEY: Why…?\r\n\r\nGRILLBY: (Looks over to the punters and then back at Flowey) I don't want any trouble.\r\n\r\nFLOWEY: I'm not causing trouble, I'm just having a drink!\r\n\r\nGRILLBY: Your presence here is the trouble, I suggest you leave.\r\n\r\nFLOWEY: I'm not going anywhere!\r\n\r\nRANDOM PUNTER: BURN HIM, GRILLBY!\r\n\r\nGRILLBY: (Sighs nervously) For Christ sake, you best leave now!\r\n\r\nFLOWEY: (Chuckles) I'll never understand why the human spared you all!\r\n\r\nGRILLBY: Look, please go befor-\r\n\r\nGrillby was interrupted when two dogs, wearing black ninja type tracksuits, sat both sides of Flowey. They both simultaneously put down their large axes on the counter. Dogamy and Dogaressa who were mildly famous for falling in love while fighting their enemies. Grillby backed off a little but Flowey chose to ignore their annoying presences as they were making a racket sitting on their stools.\r\n\r\nDOGAMY: What have we got here then, eh? A flower? (Laughs)\r\n\r\nDOGARESSA: Aw, you're a pretty girl, aren't you?\r\n\r\nFlowey tried to ignore this comment but it wasn't working, his face was slowly giving off an angry expression.\r\n\r\nGRILLBY: Ah, my favourite couple! (But watches Flowey's frustrations) Uh…w-what can I get you two…?\r\n\r\nDOGAMY: It's alright barkeep, my good man, we're fine, we just want to know what this flowers game is, that's all.\r\n\r\nDOGARESSA: Yeah, you've got nerve coming in here!\r\n\r\nDOGAMY: We don't like you, Flower!\r\n\r\nFLOWEY: It's Flowey…\r\n\r\nDOGARESSA: We couldn't give two shits what your name is! How dare you walk into this bar, how dare you show your face again!\r\n\r\nFLOWEY: (Gritted teeth) I'm just…having…a drink…\r\n\r\nDOGAMY: After what you did? After what you put that human through? The only mistake that human did, was sparing your life!\r\n\r\nDOGARESSA: And you think you could walk on in as if everything was normal? Stupid flower!\r\n\r\nFlowey's eyes go black, his teeth producing small fangs, he squeezes his shot glass and a crack appears, he also starts to shake, trying to hold back his anger.\r\n\r\nDOGAMY: It's okay, sweetheart, this flower can go on living on its own. She'll have no friends, no one to talk to…\r\n\r\nDOGARESSA: Or even…love, no one will love you back!\r\n\r\nI'm gonna lose it…I'M GONNA LOSE IT!\r\n\r\nDOGAMY: Who would want to love this creature? (Pulls one of Flowey's petals, nearly making Flowey fall off the stool) Why don't you piss off back to the compost heap you came from?!\r\n\r\nJust then…Flowey snapped.\r\n\r\nFLOWEY: You…IDIOTS!\r\n\r\nFlowey kicked the stool with great force making Dogamy fall and let go of his petal, Dogaressa didn't have time to react as Flowey grabbed his glass and smashed it into the dog's face, the glass easily ripping through the fur and skin as blood trickled out, the force still pushing Dogaressa off the stool and falling onto the wooden flooring, the white dog was screaming in pain with glass practically covering her face. Dogamy managed to get up, if a little shaken but Flowey grabbed his collar and then gripping the male dog's fur before smashing his head a few times on the counter, each impact becoming more harder than the next and blood dripping onto the counter. Flowey smiled while he proceeding his attack on the two dogs. The male dog started to moan in pain and Flowey chucked him across the room, smashing into a table which was occupied by paying guests. Grillby watched helplessly but then quickly went to a phone. Flowey had a wicked smile and looked down at Dogaressa, who was rolling around in pain, with her hands over her face but the blood was trickling through her paws…Flowey raised his leg and then stamped on the poor female dogs, the jaw snapping at the impact…\r\n\r\nFlowey backed away from the dog as Dogaressa wasn't responding or screaming anymore. Flowey's eyes reverted back to normal…he gasped at what he down and was caperable of. He looked around the bar, everyone just stared at him with frightened expressions…the only noise was Grillby talking on the phone to someone, it sounded like he was calling Undyne, one of the king's best guards.\r\n\r\nFlowey started to hyperventilate, his face becoming fear, sweat dripping down his face and he didn't hesitate to turn and run out of the bar, with people moving out of his way.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later.\r\n\r\nFlowey climbed to a spot that he knew was familiar to him, the edge of the underworld and humans. He took him a while but he managed to get there. He huffed and cried, tears streaming down his face…he looked at the sun rise, it was beautiful how the sun would try and pierce through the clouds…but this wasn't the thing on his mind.\r\n\r\nFLOWEY: I…I didn't deserve to be spared…I'll…I'll never change. (He walks closer to the edge of the cliff but looks up at the sky) And…and y-you'll never know…how I feel about you…because…because I don't know how too…even when you, took me in (Frowns) I could…n-never love anyone anyway…I…(Sighs) but why would you love me back…my existences is pointless now. I…I just…I just want to…die…\r\n\r\nNo one will miss me…\r\n\r\nFlowey takes a deep breath and stretches his arms out, he feels the wind blow his tears and his leafy dress following the wind patterns. He goes to lean forwa-\r\n\r\nVOICE: Flowey? What are you..? What the hell are you doing?\r\n\r\nThis startles Flowey, he quickly turns around to see where the familiar voice is coming from but by doing so, he loses his footing and then…falls off the edge!","title":"Flowers Growing Soul page 1 by PizzaCatDavid","postdate":"4:05 PM on 4/3/2019 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gq.stibarc.mobile\">STiBaRC Mobile</a>","attachment":"1554321899408"},"2599":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"weeb hours brug\r\n\r\nthe new Rising of The Shield Hero intro is epic.\r\n\r\nAlso Malty (attached) needs to commit Sudoku.\r\n\r\n<i>I read the manga months before it became an anime and I know what happens to her later in the story 🤧🤣</i>","title":"@herronto","postdate":"4:38 PM on 4/3/2019 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://versocre.github.io/svaurora/\">Aurora</a>","attachment":"1554323779451"},"2600":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"Not too long ago, STiBaRC introduced profile pictures which were shown on a users profile.\r\n\r\nFor some time now, Aurora has taken advantage of this feature by showing profile pictures on posts and comments.\r\n\r\n<h2>Well guess what???</h2>\r\nThis feature is coming to STiBaRC!\r\nAdded by yours truly, expect to see this dazzling update within the next few days.\r\n\r\n","title":"Expanding on Profile Pictures","postdate":"12:45 AM on 4/4/2019 EST","attachment":"1554353098563"},"2601":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"When an update for STiBaRC is released, it is recommended to remove the web app from your home screen and re-add it so the web app updates, including the metadata such as splash screens.\r\n\r\nThe update that is coming sometime tomorrow will fix splash screen problems, so please do remove the current web app and re-add it. \r\n\r\nThank you.","title":"Notice for iOS Web App Users","postdate":"1:21 AM on 4/4/2019 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://stibarc.gq/\">STiBaRC Web</a>","attachment":"none"},"2602":{"poster":"BorkingtonJenkins","content":"Some Minor And Major Suggestions To Help Improve The Overall Experience When Playing In Verso's Disgusting Mule Town.\r\n\r\nMajor:\r\n- Add MCMMO\r\n  -uh idk its just fun\r\n  -Its overpowered if you waste enough of your time on  it.\r\n- Add An Digital Money Based Economy\r\n  -well, it's an actual economy, instead of giving diamonds to everyone\r\n  -will give use to even the most useless things\r\n  -will make gathering things like wood and stone easier, making building easier\r\n-Addition of /back\r\n  -it's useful :|\r\n-Hire someone to actually build things like spawn and whatnot\r\n  -will make things look better \r\n  -(Via Creative)\r\n  -(I heavily nominate myself)\r\n-Have Someone (probably joey honestly) capable of managing the server when herronjo is offline (because that's often)\r\n\r\nMinor:\r\n-(if it's in your power (configs)) change the max homes to 20 or something, and set the teleport time to a lower amount (maybe 5?)\r\n-uh idk, a declaration that joey gay\r\n ","title":"Important Minecraft Suggestions","postdate":"4:07 AM on 4/4/2019 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://stibarc.gq/\">STiBaRC Web</a>","attachment":"none"},"2603":{"poster":"Coochiemane001","content":"Comment under this post and I will call you gay all for the low price of FREE.\r\n\r\nWill deliver response as fast as possible!\r\n\r\n\r\n- Coochie Mane","title":"I will call you gay for FREE","postdate":"12:13 PM on 4/4/2019 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://stibarc.gq/\">STiBaRC Web</a>","attachment":"none"},"2604":{"poster":"alexjones.infowars","content":"My dick hard","title":"Important Update","postdate":"12:20 PM on 4/4/2019 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gq.stibarc.mobile\">STiBaRC Mobile</a>","attachment":"1554394783596"},"2605":{"poster":"BorkingtonJenkins","content":"uh\r\nI lost my completely maxed out diamond pickaxe which is irreplaceable. can I just pay like 50 diamonds to get it back?\r\nI also vote to ban creepers.\r\n","title":"@herronjo very important minecraft post","postdate":"3:36 PM on 4/4/2019 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://stibarc.gq/\">STiBaRC Web</a>","attachment":"none"},"2606":{"poster":"BorkingtonJenkins","content":"I Claim The North Western Continent","title":"Xylem","postdate":"8:21 PM on 4/4/2019 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://stibarc.gq/\">STiBaRC Web</a>","attachment":"1554423648528"},"2607":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"😭 it's a Fire HD 10 7th gen and Fire OS 5 (Android Lollipop) has been around since the 4th gen models (I still have my 4th gen).\r\n\r\nThough I wished they used a more <i>newer</i> Android version like Pie, Nougat is at least something 😬\r\n\r\nOof because I'm so cheap, I've mostly had Fire tablets since they've been released.

After Effects is primarily a keyboard and mouse application, and would require high precision even to use on a 13\" tablet. To put it on a phone has been quite a chore. Mouses have three buttons, and holding down keys can change what you're doing entirely. Having multiple actions with just two dimensions of input (X,Y) has been very hard.

asking yourselves, \"what is retribution?\" or, \"why is verbo promoting this so much?\" or even, <small>\"lul wtf is this?\"</small>\r\n\r\nas 2019 comes to a close, so does this current decade. the last ten years have been a wild ride for me, especially at the start of the decade (2010-15). writing was something i started around 2012-ish, from silly little stories to life story poems. especially during the hard times, it helped to sit down at a desk with a pen and tons of paper and just write. around the end of junior high though, i lost all my writings, so i just stopped writing all-together until just this year.\r\n\r\nretribution is a set of written poems and short stories by yours truly; no co-writers or any of that. while some of the writings are fictional, there are some based on experiences and scenarios that happened in real life. a lot of people tend to ignore someone who is in a situation where they actually need someone close to them. \r\n\r\nsometimes, you say things to people and in the end, you regret it and can't change it. \r\n\r\nsometimes, you just wish karma would catch up to someone who isn't treating you right.\r\n\r\nsometimes, you want to be happy, but someone isn't letting you. \r\n\r\nsometimes, you just want to be heard. \r\n\r\nand sometimes, you want to scream and cry, but you can't because it's a sign of weakness.\r\n\r\nalmost every writing in retribution is written towards someone or something. some are towards the same person, while others are at multiple different people. \r\n\r\nretribution for me, is a way to let it all out after all these years. it's also a message towards the people it is written to, hoping they can see their mistakes and the consequences for their actions. releasing all these writings in 2020 will allow me to let go of the past and start something new this next decade. someday though, i hope for these to get recorded and perhaps turned into songs for people to listen to.\r\n\r\ni've been teasing retribution since early september with all those poems i've been sharing here on stibarc. when it comes out on 10 january 2020, i hope you can take a read of all my work. hopefully, it will inspire you to be a better person and not be someone people don't like. \r\n\r\nthe last promotional poem for retribution before it's release is \"poem\" (yes that's the title, very ironic, i know).\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>poem</h2>\r\nwriting takes the pain away\r\nit clears my mind\r\nfrom doing something that I'd regret\r\nit's a healthy way to cope\r\nto release my emotions from the long

We want to know what makes STiBaRC unique, and why you use it. Additionally, I'd like to know what you think of the attached concept.\r\n\r\nFor those of you wondering, the redesign will happen in two major steps:\r\n1) A reskin - we're going to basically reskin the existing site, simply updating colors and fonts to the new standards (which I'll post more about when we get closer), but not touch the layout.\r\n2) A redesigned layout - Once we're mostly complete with the reskin, we're going to begin working on updating the overall layout of the site, as you can see in the attached concept. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, at this stage we're going to keep a Classic version of the site around somewhere. \r\n\r\nWe'll let you know when we have updates to share :)\r\n - Isaac","title":"STiBaRC 2020 - Suggestions","postdate":"1:22 AM on 4/14/2020 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://stibarc.com/\">STiBaRC Web</a>","attachment":"1586840621746"},"3151":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"so for my upcoming album, it includes a variety of different genres (officially, it's an alternative album) and i was wondering if that's a good thing to include a variety of genres rather than just one.\r\n\r\nthe album varies from alternative rock to country and electropop.","title":"question for music listeners","postdate":"1:23 AM on 4/14/2020 EST","attachment":"none"},"3152":{"poster":"mlp","content":"Hand Em’ Over","title":"Yer Apples","postdate":"2:43 AM on 4/14/2020 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://stibarc.com/\">STiBaRC Web</a>","attachment":"1586846615106"},"3153":{"poster":"isaacshea","content":"As you may or may not know, a day ago we announced that there are some fairly significant changes coming to STiBaRC - and all its services - very soon. Today, I have some more news about it.\r\n\r\nWe have basically finished Stage One - I know it sounds kind of crazy that it only took a day to do, but it's mainly because it's not going to be published completely at this point. Because of the backend messiness (to put it frankly) of the site, Stage One has become more or less useless to do, as you'll see if you read on. If you are interested in seeing a \"complete\" Stage One version of STiBaRC, however, you can do so at:\r\nhttps://bunnbuns.github.io/stibarc_web/index.html\r\n(this version is verified, so it will actually work as a full client if you want to use it that way)\r\n\r\nHowever, we are ramping up the size of Stage Two, now that I know just how much effort this is going to take to do. (You see, a day ago I hadn't actually looked at any of the site's code, but now I have). \r\n\r\nStage Two is now pretty much going to be a completely new client.\r\nHerronjo is going to be bringing out some fancy new API tools that will let us do a lot more with the site, and improve on the basics behind the scenes. I'm not entirely up to scratch with what he's doing over there, so keep an eye out for anything he posts about in the future. \r\nAll this pretty much means we're going to be rebuilding STiBaRC from the ground up to work with modern interface standards and all your devices. (we hope to bring out  native iOS & Android apps in the future, too). \r\n\r\nStage Two will probably be created as a separate client somewhere else, and then once we're content with it, we'll release it on the main client. \r\n\r\nI should also mention the new team behind it! I'm now working alongside Bunnbuns and Verso to make this happen, so huge kudos to them.\r\n\r\nAll in all, we now have even bigger ambitions with this update, and we will be letting you know about updates in the future.\r\n\r\n- Isaac\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. At this stage, the old API tools will be remaining for other clients to use, and chances are we will be releasing them once we're done. I'm probably also going to release a sitewide design guideline for anyone interested, too.","title":"STiBaRC 2020 - News","postdate":"7:01 AM on 4/15/2020 EST","attachment":"none"},"3154":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"we got dat google panel","title":"epic moment","postdate":"4:18 PM on 4/15/2020 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://svaurora.gq/\">Aurora</a>","attachment":"1586981925608"},"3155":{"poster":"JcgamesStudios","content":"you can see how many downvotes there are on a post","title":"stibarc is superior to reddit","postdate":"10:10 PM on 4/15/2020 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://stibarc.com/\">STiBaRC Web</a>","attachment":"none"},"3156":{"poster":"pranav","content":"im kinda shook\r\nit's a serious deal\r\nthe most powerful mobile processor there is and it's on a device that's like $399\r\n\r\nis apple okay?","title":"what are your thoughts on the iphone se2","postdate":"10:24 PM on 4/15/2020 EST","client":"<a href=\"https://stibarc.com/\">STiBaRC Web</a>","attachment":"none"},"3157":{"poster":"alluthus","content":"If you haven't heard, I announced my debut album a few weeks ago.

All the tracks are just instrumental. And unlike most albums, this one varies in tons of different genres.
